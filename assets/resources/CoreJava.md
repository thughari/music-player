**1. OOP Principles (SOLID)**

These are guidelines for writing understandable, flexible, and maintainable object-oriented code.

* **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
    * **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
    * **Example:** Instead of one `Employee` class handling calculating pay, saving employee data to a database, and generating reports, you'd have separate classes: `PayCalculator`, `EmployeeRepository`, `ReportGenerator`. Each class has a single responsibility.

* **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    * **Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
    * **Example:** Imagine a `ShapeCalculator` that calculates areas. Instead of modifying it every time you add a new shape (like `Triangle` after `Rectangle` and `Circle`), you can have a `Shape` interface with an `area()` method. New shapes implement this interface. The calculator works with any `Shape` object without needing changes.
        ```java
        interface Shape { double area(); }
        class Rectangle implements Shape { /* ... */ @Override public double area() { /* logic */ return 0; } }
        class Circle implements Shape { /* ... */ @Override public double area() { /* logic */ return 0; } }
        // Calculator uses Shape objects, doesn't need changes for new shapes
        class AreaCalculator { public double calculate(Shape shape) { return shape.area(); } }
        ```

* **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
    * **Definition:** Subtypes (child classes) must be substitutable for their base types (parent classes) without altering the correctness of the program. If class `S` is a subtype of class `T`, then objects of type `T` may be replaced with objects of type `S` without breaking the program.
    * **Example:** If you have a `Bird` class with a `fly()` method, and a `Penguin` class that extends `Bird`, making `Penguin.fly()` throw an exception or do nothing violates LSP because a `Penguin` (subtype) cannot seamlessly replace a generic `Bird` (base type) if flying is expected. A better design might involve interfaces like `Flyable`.

* **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
    * **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It's better to have many specific interfaces than one general-purpose interface.
    * **Example:** Instead of one large `Worker` interface with `work()`, `eat()`, `sleep()` methods, if you have robots that only `work()`, they shouldn't be forced to implement `eat()` and `sleep()`. Create smaller interfaces like `Workable`, `Eatable`. Robots implement `Workable`, Humans implement `Workable` and `Eatable`.
        ```java
        interface Workable { void work(); }
        interface Eatable { void eat(); }
        class Human implements Workable, Eatable { /* ... */ }
        class Robot implements Workable { /* ... */ } // Doesn't need to worry about eat()
        ```

* **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    * **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
    * **Example:** Instead of a `NotificationService` directly creating and using a `SMSSender` (low-level detail), both should depend on a `MessageSender` interface (abstraction). The `NotificationService` uses a `MessageSender`, and `SMSSender` implements `MessageSender`. This allows you to easily swap `SMSSender` with `EmailSender` without changing `NotificationService`.
        ```java
        interface MessageSender { void sendMessage(String message); }
        class SMSSender implements MessageSender { /* ... */ }
        class EmailSender implements MessageSender { /* ... */ }

        // NotificationService depends on the abstraction
        class NotificationService {
            private MessageSender sender;
            // Sender is injected (Dependency Injection is related to DIP)
            public NotificationService(MessageSender sender) { this.sender = sender; }
            public void notifyUser(String message) { sender.sendMessage(message); }
        }
        ```

---

**2. Inheritance vs. Composition**

* **Inheritance (`IS-A` relationship):**
    * **Definition:** Creating a new class (subclass) by deriving properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). Establishes an "IS-A" relationship (e.g., a `Dog` IS-A `Animal`).
    * **Example:**
        ```java
        class Animal { void eat() { System.out.println("Animal eats"); } }
        class Dog extends Animal { void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); } } // Dog IS-A Animal
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat(); // Inherited method
        myDog.bark();
        ```
    * **Caution:** Can lead to tight coupling and fragile hierarchies.

* **Composition (`HAS-A` relationship):**
    * **Definition:** Building complex objects by combining simpler objects. Instead of inheriting, a class holds references (instances) to other classes to use their functionality. Establishes a "HAS-A" relationship (e.g., a `Car` HAS-A `Engine`).
    * **Example:**
        ```java
        class Engine { void start() { System.out.println("Engine starts"); } }
        class Car {
            private Engine engine; // Car HAS-A Engine (Composition)
            public Car() { this.engine = new Engine(); }
            void drive() { engine.start(); System.out.println("Car drives"); }
        }
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.drive();
        ```
    * **Preference:** Generally preferred over inheritance ("Favor Composition over Inheritance") because it offers more flexibility and less coupling.

---

**3. Polymorphism**

* **Definition:** The ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it commonly refers to treating objects of different classes related by inheritance in a uniform way through a common superclass or interface reference. Also includes method overloading and overriding.
    * **Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism):** A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
    * **Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order) within the same class.
* **Example (Overriding):**
    ```java
    class Animal { void makeSound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); } }
    class Dog extends Animal { @Override void makeSound() { System.out.println("Woof"); } }
    class Cat extends Animal { @Override void makeSound() { System.out.println("Meow"); } }

    Animal myPet = new Dog(); // Dog object treated as Animal
    myPet.makeSound(); // Output: Woof (Dog's version is called at runtime)
    myPet = new Cat();
    myPet.makeSound(); // Output: Meow (Cat's version is called)
    ```

---

**4. Encapsulation**

* **Definition:** Bundling data (instance variables) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (a class). It often involves hiding the internal state (using `private` access modifiers) and exposing controlled access through public methods (getters and setters).
* **Example:**
    ```java
    class Employee {
        private String name; // Data hidden (private)
        private double salary;

        // Public getter to access name (controlled access)
        public String getName() { return name; }

        // Public setter to modify name (controlled access)
        public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

        // Salary might have validation in a setter or only a getter
        public double getSalary() { return salary; }

        // Constructor to initialize
        public Employee(String name, double salary) {
             this.name = name;
             this.salary = salary; // Initial setting might be allowed
        }
        // Other methods operating on data...
    }
    // Usage:
    Employee emp = new Employee("Alice", 50000);
    System.out.println(emp.getName()); // Access via getter
    // emp.salary = 60000; // Error! Cannot access private member directly
    ```

---

**5. Abstraction**

* **Definition:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features or functionalities to the user. Achieved using `abstract` classes and `interfaces`.
    * **Abstract Class:** Can have both abstract methods (no implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Cannot be instantiated directly.
    * **Interface:** Pure abstraction (before Java 8). Contains only `abstract` methods (implicitly) and `static final` constants. Classes `implement` interfaces. (Java 8+ allows default and static methods).
* **Example (Interface):**
    ```java
    // Interface defines the contract (essential feature)
    interface Vehicle {
        void start(); // Abstract method (no implementation)
        void stop();  // Abstract method
    }

    // Concrete class provides the implementation details
    class Car implements Vehicle {
        @Override public void start() { System.out.println("Car starting engine..."); }
        @Override public void stop() { System.out.println("Car applying brakes..."); }
    }

    class Bicycle implements Vehicle {
        @Override public void start() { System.out.println("Bicycle starts pedaling..."); }
        @Override public void stop() { System.out.println("Bicycle squeezing hand brakes..."); }
    }

    // User interacts with the abstraction
    Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();
    myVehicle.start(); // User doesn't need to know HOW the car starts
    myVehicle = new Bicycle();
    myVehicle.start(); // User interacts with the same methods
    ```


### 6. `equals()` and `hashCode()` Contract

* **`equals(Object obj)` Method:**
    * **Definition:** Defined in the `java.lang.Object` class, this method checks if some other object passed to it is "equal to" this object. The default implementation in `Object` simply checks for reference equality (i.e., if both references point to the exact same object in memory, like the `==` operator for objects). You override it in your classes to define *logical equality* based on the object's state (fields).
    * **Properties of `equals()`:** It must be:
        * *Reflexive*: `x.equals(x)` must be true.
        * *Symmetric*: `x.equals(y)` must be true if and only if `y.equals(x)` is true.
        * *Transitive*: If `x.equals(y)` is true and `y.equals(z)` is true, then `x.equals(z)` must be true.
        * *Consistent*: Multiple calls to `x.equals(y)` must consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in the comparison is modified.
        * *Non-null*: `x.equals(null)` must return false.

* **`hashCode()` Method:**
    * **Definition:** Also defined in `java.lang.Object`, this method returns an integer hash code value for the object. This value is used by hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable` to determine the "bucket" location where an object should be stored, allowing for efficient retrieval (close to O(1) time complexity on average).
    * **Default implementation:** Typically converts the internal memory address of the object into an integer, but this is not guaranteed.

* **The Contract:**
    * **Rule 1:** If two objects are equal according to the `equals(Object)` method, then calling the `hashCode()` method on each of the two objects *must* produce the same integer result.
    * **Rule 2:** If two objects are unequal according to the `equals(Object)` method, it is *not required* that calling the `hashCode()` method on each of the two objects produce distinct integer results. However, producing distinct results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
    * **Consistency:** The `hashCode()` value of an object should remain consistent during an application's execution unless the information used in the `equals()` comparison is modified.

* **Consequences of Violating the Contract:**
    * If you override `equals()` but *not* `hashCode()`, objects that are logically equal (according to your `equals()` method) might produce different hash codes (from the default `Object.hashCode()`).
    * This breaks hash-based collections. For example, if you put an object `obj1` into a `HashSet`, and then try to check `set.contains(obj2)` where `obj1.equals(obj2)` is true but `obj1.hashCode() != obj2.hashCode()`, the set might incorrectly report `false` because it looks in the wrong bucket based on `obj2`'s hash code.

* **Example:**
    ```java
    import java.util.Objects;

    class Point {
        private final int x;
        private final int y;

        public Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        // Getter methods for x and y (optional but good practice)
        public int getX() { return x; }
        public int getY() { return y; }

        // Overriding equals() for logical equality
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            // 1. Reference check (optimization)
            if (this == o) return true;
            // 2. Null check and type check
            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
            // 3. Cast to the correct type
            Point point = (Point) o;
            // 4. Compare significant fields
            return x == point.x && y == point.y;
        }

        // Overriding hashCode() based on the same fields used in equals()
        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            // Use Objects.hash() helper method (Java 7+) for convenience
            // or implement manually using prime numbers (e.g., 31 * x + y)
            return Objects.hash(x, y);
        }

        // Optional: toString() for better representation
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Point{" + "x=" + x + ", y=" + y + '}';
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    // Point p1 = new Point(1, 2);
    // Point p2 = new Point(1, 2);
    // Point p3 = new Point(3, 4);
    //
    // System.out.println("p1.equals(p2): " + p1.equals(p2)); // true
    // System.out.println("p1.equals(p3): " + p1.equals(p3)); // false
    //
    // System.out.println("p1.hashCode(): " + p1.hashCode()); // e.g., 994
    // System.out.println("p2.hashCode(): " + p2.hashCode()); // e.g., 994 (must be same as p1)
    // System.out.println("p3.hashCode(): " + p3.hashCode()); // e.g., 1057 (likely different)
    //
    // java.util.HashSet<Point> points = new java.util.HashSet<>();
    // points.add(p1);
    // System.out.println("points.contains(p2): " + points.contains(p2)); // true (because equals and hashCode are correct)
    ```
    **Key Takeaway:** Always override `hashCode()` if you override `equals()`, ensuring they use the same set of significant fields to maintain the contract.



### 7. Immutability

* **Definition:** An object is considered **immutable** if its internal state (the data stored in its fields) cannot be changed after the object has been created. Once an immutable object is instantiated, its state remains constant for its entire lifetime.

* **Why is Immutability Important? (Benefits):**
    * **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe. Since their state never changes, multiple threads can access the same object concurrently without any risk of race conditions or needing synchronization.
    * **Simplicity & Predictability:** Code using immutable objects is often easier to reason about because you know the object's state won't change unexpectedly.
    * **Cacheability:** Immutable objects are excellent candidates for caching. Since their state doesn't change, a cached instance is always valid (e.g., the String pool, Integer caching for small values).
    * **Reliability / Defensiveness:** Prevents accidental modification of an object's state. They make great keys for `Map`s and elements for `Set`s because their `hashCode()` value is guaranteed not to change after creation (assuming `hashCode` depends only on immutable state).

* **How to Create an Immutable Class:**
    1.  **Declare the class as `final`:** This prevents subclasses from overriding methods and potentially introducing mutability.
    2.  **Make all fields `private` and `final`:** `private` prevents direct access from outside, and `final` ensures each field can only be assigned once (typically in the constructor).
    3.  **Do not provide "setter" methods:** Only provide methods to access the state (getters), not to modify it.
    4.  **Initialize all fields in the constructor:** Set the state completely upon creation.
    5.  **Handle Mutable Component Fields (Defensive Copies):** If your immutable class contains fields that are references to *mutable* objects (like `java.util.Date`, `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, custom mutable objects):
        * **In the constructor:** Do not store the original mutable object passed in. Create a deep copy of it and store the copy. This prevents external code holding a reference to the original mutable object from changing your immutable object's internal state.
        * **In getter methods:** Do not return the internal mutable object reference directly. Return a deep copy of the internal object, or return an unmodifiable view (e.g., using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`). This prevents external code from getting the internal reference and modifying the state.

* **Examples:**
    * **Built-in:** `java.lang.String`, primitive wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Long`, `Boolean`, etc.), `java.math.BigInteger`, `java.math.BigDecimal`, most `java.time` classes (`LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `Duration`).
    * **Custom Immutable Class:**

        ```java
        import java.util.Date;
        import java.util.List;
        import java.util.ArrayList;
        import java.util.Collections;

        // 1. Class is final
        public final class UserProfile {

            // 2. Fields are private and final
            private final String username;
            private final Date registrationDate; // Mutable field!
            private final List<String> roles;    // Mutable field!

            // 4. Initialize all fields in constructor
            public UserProfile(String username, Date regDate, List<String> userRoles) {
                this.username = username;

                // 5a. Defensive copy for mutable Date in constructor
                this.registrationDate = new Date(regDate.getTime());

                // 5a. Defensive copy for mutable List in constructor
                this.roles = new ArrayList<>(userRoles); // Create a new list copy
            }

            // 3. No setter methods

            // Getters
            public String getUsername() {
                return username;
            }

            // 5b. Defensive copy for mutable Date in getter
            public Date getRegistrationDate() {
                return new Date(registrationDate.getTime()); // Return a copy
            }

            // 5b. Return unmodifiable view for mutable List in getter
            public List<String> getRoles() {
                // return new ArrayList<>(roles); // Option 1: Return a copy
                return Collections.unmodifiableList(roles); // Option 2: Return unmodifiable view
            }

            // equals() and hashCode() should be implemented based on state
            // toString() is helpful too
        }

        // Usage:
        // Date reg = new Date();
        // List<String> userRoles = new ArrayList<>();
        // userRoles.add("ADMIN");
        //
        // UserProfile profile1 = new UserProfile("testuser", reg, userRoles);
        //
        // // Attempt to modify original mutable objects - won't affect profile1's state
        // reg.setTime(0);
        // userRoles.add("USER");
        //
        // // Attempt to modify object returned by getter - won't affect profile1's state
        // Date retrievedDate = profile1.getRegistrationDate();
        // retrievedDate.setTime(1);
        //
        // try {
        //    List<String> retrievedRoles = profile1.getRoles();
        //    retrievedRoles.add("GUEST"); // Throws UnsupportedOperationException if unmodifiableList was used
        // } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        //    System.out.println("Cannot modify roles list returned by getter.");
        // }
        //
        // System.out.println(profile1.getRegistrationDate()); // Still shows original registration date
        // System.out.println(profile1.getRoles()); // Still shows only [ADMIN]
        ```



### 8. Collections Framework

* **Definition:** A unified architecture provided by Java for representing and manipulating groups of objects, known as collections. It consists of interfaces, implementations (classes), and algorithms.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Reduces Programming Effort:** Provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.
    * **Increases Performance:** Implementations are highly optimized.
    * **Interoperability:** Allows collections to be passed around and manipulated using common interface methods.
    * **Encourages Software Reuse:** Promotes the use of standard, well-tested components.

* **Core Interfaces:**

    * **`Collection<E>`:** The root interface for most collections (excluding Maps). Represents a generic group of objects (elements). Defines basic methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`, `iterator()`.

    * **`List<E>`:**
        * **Characteristics:** An *ordered* collection (also known as a sequence). Elements can be accessed by their integer index. *Allows duplicate* elements.
        * **Common Implementations:** `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.

    * **`Set<E>`:**
        * **Characteristics:** A collection that contains *no duplicate* elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. Order is *not guaranteed* by the base interface (though some implementations maintain order).
        * **Common Implementations:** `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`.

    * **`Queue<E>`:**
        * **Characteristics:** A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Typically orders elements in a **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** manner, but other orderings (like LIFO or priority-based) are possible depending on the implementation.
        * **Common Implementations:** `LinkedList` (implements `Queue`), `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`.

    * **`Map<K, V>`:**
        * **Characteristics:** *Technically not a `Collection`*, but part of the framework. An object that maps unique **keys** (`K`) to **values** (`V`). Each key can map to at most one value. Order depends on the implementation.
        * **Common Implementations:** `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`.

* **Key Implementations:**

    * **`ArrayList<E>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Dynamically resizing array.
        * **Performance:** Fast for random access (`get(index)`) - O(1). Slower for adding/removing elements in the middle - O(n) average.
        * **Ordering:** Maintains insertion order.
        * **Use Case:** General-purpose list when random access is frequent, and middle insertions/deletions are less common. Not synchronized.

    * **`LinkedList<E>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Doubly-linked list (each element holds references to the previous and next element).
        * **Performance:** Fast for adding/removing elements at the beginning/end - O(1). Fast insertions/deletions in the middle *if you have an iterator positioned there* - O(1). Slower for random access (`get(index)`) - O(n).
        * **Ordering:** Maintains insertion order.
        * **Use Case:** When insertions/deletions are frequent, especially at the ends. Good for implementing Stacks (`push`/`pop`) and Queues (`offer`/`poll`). Not synchronized.

    * **`HashSet<E>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Uses a `HashMap` internally.
        * **Performance:** Best average performance for `add`, `remove`, `contains` - O(1) average.
        * **Ordering:** *Does not* guarantee any order. Order might even change over time.
        * **Notes:** Requires elements to correctly implement `equals()` and `hashCode()`. Allows one `null` element. Not synchronized.

    * **`LinkedHashSet<E>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Extends `HashSet`, uses a `LinkedHashMap` internally.
        * **Performance:** Similar to `HashSet` (O(1) average), but slightly higher overhead due to maintaining links.
        * **Ordering:** Maintains **insertion order**.
        * **Notes:** Requires correct `equals()` and `hashCode()`. Not synchronized.

    * **`TreeSet<E>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Uses a Red-Black tree (a self-balancing binary search tree), backed by a `TreeMap`.
        * **Performance:** Slower than hash-based sets - O(log n) for `add`, `remove`, `contains`.
        * **Ordering:** Stores elements in **sorted order** (either natural ordering of elements or using a provided `Comparator`).
        * **Notes:** Elements must be comparable (implement `Comparable` or provide a `Comparator`). Does not allow `null` elements (unless comparator handles nulls). Not synchronized.

    * **`HashMap<K, V>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Hash table (array of linked lists or balanced trees starting from Java 8 for collision handling).
        * **Performance:** Best average performance for `put`, `get`, `remove` - O(1) average.
        * **Ordering:** *Does not* guarantee any order.
        * **Notes:** Requires keys to correctly implement `equals()` and `hashCode()`. Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values. Not synchronized.

    * **`LinkedHashMap<K, V>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Extends `HashMap`, maintains a doubly-linked list running through entries.
        * **Performance:** Similar to `HashMap` (O(1) average), slightly higher overhead.
        * **Ordering:** Maintains **insertion order** (default) or **access order**.
        * **Notes:** Requires correct `equals()` and `hashCode()` for keys. Not synchronized.

    * **`TreeMap<K, V>`:**
        * **Underlying Structure:** Red-Black tree.
        * **Performance:** Slower than hash-based maps - O(log n) for `put`, `get`, `remove`.
        * **Ordering:** Stores entries **sorted by key** (natural ordering or using a `Comparator`).
        * **Notes:** Keys must be comparable. Does not allow a `null` key (unless comparator handles nulls). Not synchronized.

* **Other Important Concepts:**

    * **`Iterator<E>`:** An object used to traverse (iterate over) the elements in a collection. Provides `hasNext()`, `next()`, and optionally `remove()`. Preferred way to loop and remove elements concurrently (using `iterator.remove()`).
    * **Fail-Fast vs. Fail-Safe:** Most standard collections have fail-fast iterators (throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is structurally modified while iterating, except through the iterator's own `remove` method). Concurrent collections often have fail-safe/weakly consistent iterators (operate on a snapshot or copy, don't throw the exception, but may not reflect recent updates).
    * **`Collections` Utility Class:** Provides static helper methods like `sort()`, `binarySearch()`, `reverse()`, `shuffle()`, `synchronizedList()`, `unmodifiableList()`, etc.
    * **Concurrent Collections (`java.util.concurrent`):** Thread-safe alternatives like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue` implementations, designed for high-concurrency scenarios.

* **Example:**

    ```java
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.HashSet;
    import java.util.Set;

    public class CollectionsExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // --- List Example (ArrayList) ---
            List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
            names.add("Alice");
            names.add("Bob");
            names.add("Charlie");
            names.add("Alice"); // Duplicates allowed

            System.out.println("Names List: " + names); // [Alice, Bob, Charlie, Alice]
            System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + names.get(1)); // Bob

            // --- Set Example (HashSet) ---
            Set<String> uniqueNames = new HashSet<>(names); // Initialize with list elements
            uniqueNames.add("David");
            boolean addedAliceAgain = uniqueNames.add("Alice"); // Returns false, Alice already exists

            System.out.println("\nUnique Names Set: " + uniqueNames); // Order not guaranteed, no duplicates
            System.out.println("Was Alice added again? " + addedAliceAgain); // false
            System.out.println("Does set contain 'Charlie'? " + uniqueNames.contains("Charlie")); // true

            // --- Map Example (HashMap) ---
            Map<String, Integer> cityPopulations = new HashMap<>();
            cityPopulations.put("New York", 8_400_000);
            cityPopulations.put("London", 9_000_000);
            cityPopulations.put("Tokyo", 37_000_000);
            cityPopulations.put("London", 9_100_000); // Updates the value for key "London"

            System.out.println("\nCity Populations Map: " + cityPopulations);
            System.out.println("Population of London: " + cityPopulations.get("London")); // 9100000

            System.out.println("\nIterating through map entries:");
            for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : cityPopulations.entrySet()) {
                System.out.println("City: " + entry.getKey() + ", Population: " + entry.getValue());
            }
        }
    }
    ```


### 9. Exception Handling

**Definition:** Exception handling is a mechanism in Java to deal with runtime errors or unexpected conditions that disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. When such an event occurs, an "exception" is thrown. The exception handling system allows you to "catch" these exceptions and handle them gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.

**Why is it Important?**

* **Robustness:** Makes your program more resilient to unexpected issues, preventing abrupt termination.
* **Graceful Degradation:** Allows you to handle errors smoothly, potentially recovering or providing informative feedback to the user, rather than just stopping.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Separates the normal program logic from the error-handling code.
* **Maintainability:** Centralizes error handling, making code easier to understand and maintain.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Errors vs. Exceptions:**
    * `Error`: Represents serious problems that applications should not try to catch (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`). They are typically caused by external factors or critical system failures.
    * `Exception`: Represents conditions that an application *might* want to catch and handle (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).
* **Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions:**
    * **Checked Exceptions:** Exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle or declare that your method might throw. They typically represent predictable, but unrecoverable problems if not handled (e.g., `IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `SQLException`). You must either catch them using `try-catch` or declare them using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.
    * **Unchecked Exceptions:** Exceptions that the compiler *does not* force you to handle. They typically represent programming errors or unexpected issues that are often indicative of bugs (e.g., `RuntimeException` and its subclasses like `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ArithmeticException`). While you *can* catch them, you are not required to.

**How to Handle Exceptions:**

* **`try` block:** Contains the code that might throw an exception.
* **`catch` block:** Follows a `try` block. It specifies the type of exception it can handle and contains the code to execute if that specific exception occurs within the `try` block. You can have multiple `catch` blocks for different exception types.
* **`finally` block:** Follows `try` (and optional `catch` blocks). The code in the `finally` block *always* executes, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It's typically used for cleanup operations (like closing files or network connections).

```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
    System.out.println("This line will not be executed.");
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Code to handle ArithmeticException
    System.err.println("Error: Division by zero occurred!");
    System.err.println("Exception details: " + e.getMessage());
    // e.printStackTrace(); // Useful for debugging
} catch (Exception e) { // Generic catch block (less specific exceptions last)
    System.err.println("An unexpected error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    // This block always executes
    System.out.println("Finally block executed. Cleanup operations go here.");
}
System.out.println("Program continues after exception handling.");
```

**How to Declare and Throw Exceptions:**

* **`throws` keyword:** Used in a method signature to declare that the method *might* throw one or more checked exceptions. This shifts the responsibility of handling the exception to the caller of the method.

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    // Declaring that this method might throw an IOException
    public void readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
        FileReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new FileReader(filePath);
            // Read from the file...
            int character;
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) character);
            }
        } finally {
            // Cleanup: ensure the reader is closed even if an exception occurs
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close(); // close() itself can throw IOException!
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileReaderExample example = new FileReaderExample();
        try {
            // The caller must handle the potentially thrown IOException
            example.readFile("my_file.txt");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

* **`throw` keyword:** Used to explicitly *throw* an exception object from within your code. You can throw instances of existing exception classes or custom exception classes you create.

```java
public class CustomExceptionExample {

    // Method that throws an exception based on a condition
    public void processInput(int value) {
        if (value < 0) {
            // Throw a new instance of IllegalArgumentException
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input value cannot be negative: " + value);
        }
        // Process the input if value is not negative
        System.out.println("Processing value: " + value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomExceptionExample example = new CustomExceptionExample();
        try {
            example.processInput(10);
            example.processInput(-5); // This will throw an exception
            System.out.println("This line will not be reached after throwing.");
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.err.println("Caught an exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues after catching.");
    }
}
```

**Common Exception Classes (Examples):**

* `IOException` (Checked): Problems with input/output operations (file not found, network issues).
* `SQLException` (Checked): Problems with database access.
* `ClassNotFoundException` (Checked): Trying to load a class that doesn't exist.
* `RuntimeException` (Unchecked base class):
    * `NullPointerException`: Trying to access a member of a null object reference.
    * `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Accessing an array with an invalid index.
    * `ArithmeticException`: Exceptional arithmetic conditions (like division by zero).
    * `ClassCastException`: Trying to cast an object to a type it's not an instance of.
    * `IllegalArgumentException`: A method received an inappropriate argument.
    * `IllegalStateException`: A method was invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time.

**Key Takeaway:** Understand the difference between Errors and Exceptions, Checked and Unchecked exceptions. Use `try-catch-finally` to handle exceptions that might occur and `throws` to declare exceptions that your methods might throw.


### 10. I/O Streams

**Definition:** In Java, Input/Output (I/O) is handled using streams. A stream is an abstract representation of a flow of data. It's a sequence of data that has a source (for input streams) or a destination (for output streams). Think of it like a pipe where data flows from one end to the other.

**Concept of Streams:**

* Streams provide a common, abstract way to interact with various I/O devices (files, network connections, console, memory buffers, etc.).
* They abstract away the underlying complexities of the device. You read from an `InputStream` or write to an `OutputStream` regardless of whether it's a file or a network socket.

**Types of Streams:**

Java streams are broadly categorized into two main types based on the type of data they handle:

1.  **Byte Streams:**
    * Operate on raw bytes (8-bit).
    * Used for handling binary data (images, audio, serialized objects) or when character encoding isn't a concern at the stream level.
    * Base abstract classes: `InputStream` (for reading bytes) and `OutputStream` (for writing bytes).
2.  **Character Streams:**
    * Operate on 16-bit Unicode characters.
    * Used for handling text data. They automatically handle character encoding conversions.
    * Base abstract classes: `Reader` (for reading characters) and `Writer` (for writing characters).

**Input Streams vs. Output Streams:**

* **Input Streams (`InputStream`, `Reader`):** Used to read data *from* a source into your Java program. Data flows *into* the program.
* **Output Streams (`OutputStream`, `Writer`):** Used to write data *from* your Java program *to* a destination. Data flows *out of* the program.

**Common Stream Classes (Examples):**

* **Byte Streams:**
    * `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`: For reading/writing bytes to/from files.
    * `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`: For reading/writing bytes to/from a memory buffer (byte array).
    * `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`: Add buffering to byte streams for performance improvement.
    * `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`: For reading/writing serialized Java objects.
* **Character Streams:**
    * `FileReader`, `FileWriter`: For reading/writing characters to/from files (use system's default encoding).
    * `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`: Add buffering to character streams for performance.
    * `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`: Bridges between byte streams and character streams, allowing you to specify character encoding. `InputStreamReader` reads bytes and decodes them into characters; `OutputStreamWriter` takes characters and encodes them into bytes.
    * `StringReader`, `StringWriter`: For reading/writing characters to/from a string buffer.
    * `PrintWriter`: A convenient class for writing formatted text (like `println()`) to a character stream or an `OutputStream`.

**Buffering:**

* Decorating a stream with a buffered stream (`BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`) wraps the original stream and adds an internal buffer.
* Reading/writing happens in larger chunks to/from the buffer in memory, reducing the number of slow physical I/O operations (disk reads/writes).
* This significantly improves performance, especially for frequent small read/write operations.

**`try-with-resources` Statement (Java 7+):**

* A syntactic convenience introduced to ensure that resources (like streams, network sockets, database connections) that implement the `AutoCloseable` interface are automatically closed at the end of the `try` block, regardless of whether the `try` block completes normally or throws an exception.
* This is the recommended way to handle streams and other closeable resources, as it avoids common mistakes with manual `finally` blocks (like forgetting to close, or handling exceptions within the `finally` block's `close()` call).

```java
// Old way (pre-Java 7) - requires a finally block
FileInputStream fis = null;
try {
    fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
    // Use fis...
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (fis != null) {
        try {
            fis.close(); // close() itself can throw IOException!
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

// Recommended way (Java 7+) - using try-with-resources
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt")) {
    // Use fis... Java automatically closes it
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// No finally block needed for closing fis
```

**Example: Reading from and Writing to a File (using Character Streams with Buffering)**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCopyExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sourceFile = "input.txt";  // Create a dummy input.txt with some text
        String targetFile = "output.txt"; // This file will be created/overwritten

        // Using try-with-resources for automatic resource closing
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(sourceFile));
             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(targetFile))) {

            String line;
            // Read line by line from the source file
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // Write the line to the target file
                writer.write(line);
                writer.newLine(); // Write a new line separator
            }

            System.out.println("File copied successfully from " + sourceFile + " to " + targetFile);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle potential exceptions (e.g., file not found, permission issues)
            System.err.println("An error occurred during file processing:");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Understand the stream concept, the difference between byte and character streams, input and output, and the importance of buffering. Always use `try-with-resources` to ensure streams are closed properly.




### 11. Serialization

**Definition:** Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. This byte stream can then be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in memory. Deserialization is the reverse process: converting a byte stream back into a live Java object in memory.

**Why is it Useful?**

* **Persistence:** Allows you to save the state of an object to a persistent storage (like a file) and restore it later.
* **Networking:** Enables sending objects over a network connection (e.g., RMI - Remote Method Invocation, or in certain messaging systems). You serialize an object on one end, send the bytes, and deserialize it on the other end.
* **Cloning:** Can be used as a way to perform a deep copy of an object (though this is often less efficient than dedicated cloning mechanisms if available).

**How to Make a Class Serializable:**

To make an object of a class eligible for serialization, the class must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. This is a marker interface, meaning it doesn't have any methods to implement. It simply signals to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that objects of this class *can* be serialized.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class MySerializableClass implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    // Other fields...

    public MySerializableClass(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Getters, setters, etc.
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getId() { return id; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "MySerializableClass [name=" + name + ", id=" + id + "]";
    }
}
```

**The `transient` Keyword:**

* If you have fields in your serializable class that you *do not* want to be part of the serialized state (e.g., sensitive data, resources like streams, or data that can be derived), you can mark them with the `transient` keyword.
* `transient` fields are ignored during the serialization process. When the object is deserialized, `transient` fields will be initialized to their default values (0 for numeric types, `false` for boolean, `null` for object references).

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class UserSettings implements Serializable {
    private String username;
    private transient String password; // Don't serialize the password!
    private int fontSize;

    public UserSettings(String username, String password, int fontSize) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password; // Stored in memory, but not serialized
        this.fontSize = fontSize;
    }

    public String getUsername() { return username; }
    public String getPassword() {
        // Note: After deserialization, this will be null
        return password;
    }
    public int getFontSize() { return fontSize; }

     @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "UserSettings [username=" + username + ", password=" + password + ", fontSize=" + fontSize + "]";
    }
}
```

**Serialization and Deserialization Streams:**

Java provides specific streams for handling object serialization:

* `ObjectOutputStream`: Used to write primitive data types and graphs of Java objects to an `OutputStream`. It has a `writeObject(Object obj)` method.
* `ObjectInputStream`: Used to read primitive data types and graphs of Java objects from an `InputStream`. It has an `readObject()` method, which returns an `Object` that needs to be cast to the appropriate type.

**Handling Versioning (`serialVersionUID`):**

* The serialization mechanism associates a version number with each serializable class. This number is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes that are compatible with respect to serialization.
* If the `serialVersionUID` of the class during deserialization doesn't match the `serialVersionUID` recorded in the serialized stream, a `InvalidClassException` is thrown.
* If you don't explicitly declare a `serialVersionUID`, the JVM automatically generates one based on the class's structure (fields, methods, etc.). However, this auto-generated ID can change even for minor code changes, leading to compatibility issues.
* It's highly recommended to explicitly declare a `static final long serialVersionUID` in your serializable classes. You can generate an initial value (e.g., using an IDE) and only change it if you make incompatible changes to the class structure (like removing a field).

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Product implements Serializable {
    // Recommended: Declare serialVersionUID for version compatibility
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; // Start with 1L

    private String name;
    private double price;
    // private String category; // If you add/remove fields, you might update serialVersionUID

    public Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public double getPrice() { return price; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product [name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "]";
    }
}
```

**Example: Serialization and Deserialization**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class SerializationExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product originalProduct = new Product("Laptop", 1200.50);
        String filename = "product.ser";

        // --- Serialization ---
        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filename))) {
            oos.writeObject(originalProduct);
            System.out.println("Product object serialized to " + filename);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // --- Deserialization ---
        Product deserializedProduct = null;
        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename))) {
            // readObject() returns Object, needs casting
            deserializedProduct = (Product) ois.readObject();
            System.out.println("Product object deserialized from " + filename);
            System.out.println("Deserialized Product: " + deserializedProduct);

            // Verify the state
            System.out.println("Name: " + deserializedProduct.getName());
            System.out.println("Price: " + deserializedProduct.getPrice());

        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

// Assume Product class (from above) is available and implements Serializable
/*
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Product implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public double getPrice() { return price; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product [name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "]";
    }
}
*/
```
*(To run the example, ensure the `Product.java` file exists with the class definition provided above)*

**Key Takeaway:** Serialization allows saving and restoring object states. Implement `Serializable` to make a class serializable. Use `transient` for fields you don't want to serialize. Use `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` for the process. Always declare `serialVersionUID` for version compatibility.



### 12. Generics

**Definition:** Generics is a feature introduced in Java 5 that allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters. This enables you to write code that can work with different types while providing type safety at compile time.

**Why are they Needed? (Limitations before Generics):**

Before Generics, collections like `ArrayList` stored elements as `Object`. This had two main drawbacks:

1.  **No Type Safety:** You could add objects of different types to the same collection, and the compiler wouldn't complain.
2.  **Runtime Errors & Manual Casting:** When retrieving elements, you had to manually cast the `Object` back to its original type. If you cast to the wrong type, you would get a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

```java
// Pre-Generics Example (Problematic)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List myOldList = new ArrayList(); // Stores Objects
myOldList.add("Hello");
myOldList.add(123); // Can add different types

// Retrieving requires casting, risking ClassCastException
String str = (String) myOldList.get(0); // OK
// Integer num = (Integer) myOldList.get(1); // OK
// Double d = (Double) myOldList.get(0); // RISKY! Throws ClassCastException at runtime
```

**Benefits of Generics:**

* **Type Safety:** The compiler enforces the type of elements that can be stored in a generic collection or used with a generic class/method. This prevents accidental insertion of incorrect types.
* **Elimination of Casts:** Since the compiler knows the type, you don't need to explicitly cast when retrieving elements from generic collections, leading to cleaner and less error-prone code.
* **Compile-time Checking:** Type mismatches are detected by the compiler *before* the code runs, catching potential `ClassCastException` issues early.

```java
// With Generics Example (Type-Safe)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List<String> myNewList = new ArrayList<>(); // Stores only Strings
myNewList.add("Hello");
// myNewList.add(123); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR! Type mismatch

String str = myNewList.get(0); // No cast needed!
```

**Basic Syntax:**

* **Generic Classes:**
    ```java
    // T is a type parameter (commonly stands for Type)
    public class Box<T> {
        private T content;

        public void setContent(T content) {
            this.content = content;
        }

        public T getContent() {
            return content;
        }
    }

    // Usage: Specify the type in angled brackets <>
    Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
    stringBox.setContent("Generic Hello");
    String message = stringBox.getContent(); // No cast

    Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
    integerBox.setContent(100);
    int number = integerBox.getContent(); // No cast
    ```
* **Generic Interfaces:**
    ```java
    public interface MyRepository<T, ID> { // T is the entity type, ID is the ID type
        T findById(ID id);
        void save(T entity);
        // ... other methods
    }

    // Implementation
    public class UserRepository implements MyRepository<User, Long> {
        @Override
        public User findById(Long id) { /* ... */ return null; }
        @Override
        public void save(User entity) { /* ... */ }
    }
    ```
* **Generic Methods:**
    ```java
    // <T> before the return type declares the type parameter
    public class ArrayUtil {
        public static <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
            for (T element : array) {
                System.out.print(element + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    // Usage: Compiler infers the type T
    Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};
    ArrayUtil.printArray(intArray); // T is inferred as Integer

    String[] stringArray = {"A", "B", "C"};
    ArrayUtil.printArray(stringArray); // T is inferred as String
    ```
    *(Note: You can also have bounded type parameters using `extends` or `super` in declarations)*

**Wildcards (`?`):**

Wildcards represent an unknown type and are used in generic code primarily when working with collections or methods that operate on collections of varying (but related) types.

* **Unbounded Wildcard (`?`):** Represents any type.
    ```java
    public void printList(List<?> list) {
        // You can read elements (they are of type Object)
        for (Object obj : list) {
            System.out.println(obj);
        }
        // You CANNOT add elements (except null) because the type is unknown
        // list.add("something"); // Compile-time error
    }
    ```
    Use when you want to work with any type but only need to read from the collection (or call methods that don't depend on the specific type parameter).
* **Bounded Wildcard (`? extends T`):** Represents an unknown type that is `T` or a *subtype* of `T`. This establishes an upper bound.
    ```java
    public void processNumbers(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
        // You can read elements (they are at least Number)
        for (Number num : numbers) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
        // You CANNOT add elements because you don't know the exact subtype
        // numbers.add(new Integer(10)); // Compile-time error
    }
    // Can accept List<Integer>, List<Double>, List<Number>, etc.
    ```
    Use when you want to read elements from a collection where the elements are of a specific type or one of its subtypes (covariance).
* **Bounded Wildcard (`? super T`):** Represents an unknown type that is `T` or a *supertype* of `T`. This establishes a lower bound.
    ```java
    public void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) {
        // You CAN add elements (they must be Integer or a subtype - Integer itself is fine)
        list.add(10);
        list.add(new Integer(20));
        // You CANNOT read elements as anything more specific than Object
        // Object obj = list.get(0); // OK
        // Integer i = list.get(0); // Compile-time error - might be List<Number> or List<Object>
    }
    // Can accept List<Integer>, List<Number>, List<Object>, etc.
    ```
    Use when you want to add elements to a collection where the elements are of a specific type or one of its supertypes (contravariance).

*(Tip: Remember PECS - Producer Extends, Consumer Super. If your collection is a "Producer" of T (you read from it), use `? extends T`. If your collection is a "Consumer" of T (you write to it), use `? super T`.)*

**Type Erasure:**

* Generics are primarily a compile-time feature in Java. To maintain backward compatibility with older Java code, the compiler performs "type erasure".
* After the compiler checks for type safety, it erases the generic type information. For example, `List<String>` becomes just `List` (or raw `List`) at runtime, and `Box<T>` becomes `Box`.
* Casts are inserted automatically by the compiler where needed when retrieving elements from generic collections.
* This means generic type information is not available at runtime (with some exceptions like examining method signatures or class definitions via Reflection).

**Example: Generic Class and Method**

```java
public class Pair<K, V> { // K for Key, V for Value (common conventions)
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    // A generic method within the class
    public <T> boolean contains(T element) {
        return (key != null && key.equals(element)) || (value != null && value.equals(element));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the generic Pair class
        Pair<String, Integer> studentScore = new Pair<>("Alice", 95);
        System.out.println("Key: " + studentScore.getKey() + ", Value: " + studentScore.getValue()); // No casts

        Pair<Double, String> coordinate = new Pair<>(10.5, "X");
        System.out.println("Key: " + coordinate.getKey() + ", Value: " + coordinate.getValue());

        // Using the generic method
        System.out.println("Does studentScore pair contain 'Alice'? " + studentScore.contains("Alice")); // T inferred as String
        System.out.println("Does studentScore pair contain 95? " + studentScore.contains(95));       // T inferred as Integer
        System.out.println("Does coordinate pair contain 10.5? " + coordinate.contains(10.5));       // T inferred as Double
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Generics provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for manual casting when working with collections and other parameterized types. Understand the basic syntax, common wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`), and the concept of Type Erasure.




### 13. Enums (Enumerations)

**Definition:** An enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type in Java that is used to define a fixed collection of constants. It's essentially a class type, but with a predefined set of instances.

**Why are they Useful?**

* **Improved Type Safety:** Enums provide type safety compared to using simple `int` or `String` constants. You can only assign valid enum constants to an enum variable, preventing errors caused by using incorrect or misspelled constant values.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Enum constants have meaningful names, making code easier to read and understand. If you need to add, remove, or change constants, you only need to modify the enum definition.
* **Avoiding "Magic Numbers" or Strings:** Replaces arbitrary numeric or string constant values with well-defined, type-safe enum constants.
* **Can have behavior:** Unlike simple constants, enums can have fields, constructors, and methods, allowing you to associate data and behavior with each constant.

**Basic Syntax:**

You declare an enum using the `enum` keyword. The constants are listed inside the enum body, separated by commas.

```java
public enum DayOfWeek {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}

// Usage:
DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;

if (today == DayOfWeek.MONDAY) {
    System.out.println("It's Monday!");
}

// You cannot assign anything else:
// DayOfWeek invalidDay = "Funday"; // Compile-time error
```

**Enums with Fields, Constructors, and Methods:**

Enums can be more than just a list of names. They can have instance fields, constructors, and methods, just like a regular class.

* **Fields:** Declare fields to store data associated with each enum constant.
* **Constructor:** Enums have constructors, but they must be declared as `private` or package-private. They are invoked implicitly when the enum constants are declared.
* **Methods:** Define methods to add behavior to your enum constants. You can define abstract methods in the enum body and require each constant to implement them.

```java
public enum TrafficLight {
    RED(30, "Stop"),
    YELLOW(5, "Caution"),
    GREEN(25, "Go");

    private final int duration; // Field to store duration
    private final String action; // Field to store action

    // Private constructor
    private TrafficLight(int duration, String action) {
        this.duration = duration;
        this.action = action;
    }

    // Getter methods
    public int getDuration() {
        return duration;
    }

    public String getAction() {
        return action;
    }

    // Example method
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Light: " + this.name() +
                           ", Duration: " + duration + "s" +
                           ", Action: " + action);
    }
}

// Usage:
TrafficLight currentLight = TrafficLight.RED;
System.out.println("Current light is: " + currentLight); // Prints: RED
System.out.println("Duration: " + currentLight.getDuration() + " seconds"); // Prints: 30
currentLight.displayInfo(); // Calls the method on the constant

TrafficLight nextLight = TrafficLight.GREEN;
nextLight.displayInfo();
```
*(Note: The list of enum constants MUST be the first thing in the enum body. If you have fields, constructors, or methods, the list of constants must be terminated by a semicolon `;`.)*

**`ordinal()` and `name()` Methods:**

All enums implicitly inherit from `java.lang.Enum`. This base class provides some useful methods:

* `name()`: Returns the name of this enum constant, exactly as declared in the enum declaration.
* `ordinal()`: Returns the ordinal of this enumeration constant (its position in its enum declaration, where the initial constant is assigned an ordinal of 0).

```java
DayOfWeek day = DayOfWeek.TUESDAY;

System.out.println("Name: " + day.name());    // Prints: TUESDAY
System.out.println("Ordinal: " + day.ordinal()); // Prints: 2 (SUNDAY=0, MONDAY=1, TUESDAY=2)

TrafficLight light = TrafficLight.YELLOW;
System.out.println("Name: " + light.name());    // Prints: YELLOW
System.out.println("Ordinal: " + light.ordinal()); // Prints: 1 (RED=0, YELLOW=1, GREEN=2)
```
*(Caution: Relying heavily on the `ordinal()` value is generally discouraged, as changing the order of constants in the enum definition will change the ordinal values, potentially breaking code that depends on them. `name()` is often safer for identification.)*

**`valueOf(String name)` Method:**

All enums also have a static `valueOf(String name)` method that returns the enum constant with the specified name.

```java
String dayString = "FRIDAY";
DayOfWeek friday = DayOfWeek.valueOf(dayString); // Case-sensitive
System.out.println("Parsed day: " + friday); // Prints: FRIDAY

// If the name doesn't match any constant, throws IllegalArgumentException
// DayOfWeek invalid = DayOfWeek.valueOf("FUNDAY"); // Throws IllegalArgumentException
```

**Key Takeaway:** Use enums for a fixed set of related constants. They offer type safety, readability, and the ability to associate data and behavior with constants. Understand the basic syntax and how to add fields, constructors, and methods. Be aware of `name()`, `ordinal()`, and `valueOf()`.



### 14. Annotations

**Definition:** Annotations, introduced in Java 5, are a form of metadata that can be added to source code elements (like classes, methods, fields, parameters, etc.). They provide information about the code but do not directly affect its execution.

**What are they Used For?**

Annotations are used to:

* **Provide Information for the Compiler:** Used to detect errors or suppress warnings (`@Override`, `@SuppressWarnings`).
* **For Build-time and Deployment-time Processing:** Software tools can read annotations to generate code, configuration files, or perform other actions (e.g., persistence frameworks like JPA/Hibernate use annotations to map objects to database tables).
* **For Runtime Processing:** Annotations can be retained at runtime and read using Reflection to influence program behavior (e.g., frameworks like Spring or testing frameworks like JUnit use annotations for configuration and test execution).

**Built-in Annotations (Common Examples):**

* `@Override`: Marks a method that is intended to override a method in a superclass or implement a method from an interface. Helps the compiler detect if the superclass method signature is incorrect.
* `@Deprecated`: Marks a class, method, or field as deprecated, meaning it is discouraged from being used, usually because it has been superseded by a newer alternative. Compilers typically issue a warning when deprecated elements are used.
* `@SuppressWarnings("...")`: Tells the compiler to suppress specific warning messages for the annotated code element.
* `@FunctionalInterface` (Java 8+): Indicates that an interface is intended to be a functional interface (has exactly one abstract method). Helps the compiler enforce this.
* `@SafeVarargs` (Java 7+): Used on methods or constructors with variable-length arguments (varargs) to assert that they do not perform unsafe operations on their varargs array, preventing potential heap pollution warnings.

**Meta-Annotations (Annotations that annotate other annotations):**

These are annotations used when defining custom annotation types to specify how the custom annotation should be used and processed.

* `@Target`: Specifies where the annotation can be applied (e.g., `ElementType.TYPE` for a class, `ElementType.METHOD` for a method, `ElementType.FIELD` for a field, `ElementType.PARAMETER` for a method parameter, `ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR`, `ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE`, etc.).
* `@Retention`: Specifies how long the annotation should be retained:
    * `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`: Discarded by the compiler (used for compile-time processing).
    * `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`: Stored in the `.class` file but not available at runtime via Reflection (default).
    * `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`: Stored in the `.class` file and available at runtime via Reflection (most common for framework use).
* `@Inherited`: Indicates that the annotation type is automatically inherited by subclasses (when applied to a class declaration).
* `@Documented`: Indicates that elements using this annotation should be documented by the Javadoc tool.
* `@Repeatable` (Java 8+): Indicates that the annotation can be applied multiple times to the same declaration.

**Creating Custom Annotations:**

You can define your own annotation types using the `@interface` keyword.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*; // Need to import meta-annotations

// Define where the annotation can be applied (e.g., methods)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
// Define how long the annotation is retained (e.g., at runtime)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
// Make it appear in Javadoc
@Documented
public @interface CustomMethodInfo {
    // Annotation elements (like method parameters in a regular method)
    // They are like attributes you can set when using the annotation
    String author() default "Unknown"; // Element with a default value
    String version() default "1.0";
    String description(); // Element without a default value (must be provided)
    int status() default 1; // Numeric element
}
```

**How Annotations are Processed:**

Annotations themselves don't *do* anything. Their meaning and processing are handled by tools or frameworks:

* **Compiler:** Processes `@Override`, `@SuppressWarnings`, `@Deprecated`, `@FunctionalInterface`, `@SafeVarargs`.
* **Annotation Processors (APIs):** Tools that can hook into the compile-time process (`RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`, `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`) to read annotations and generate code or other artifacts.
* **Runtime (Reflection API):** Code can inspect classes, methods, etc., at runtime (`RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`) to check for and read annotations, and then take actions based on the annotation data.

**Example: Using Built-in and a Simple Custom Annotation**

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
import java.lang.annotation.Documented; // Import meta-annotations if defining custom one

// Define a simple custom annotation (if not already defined)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@interface MyInfo {
    String createdBy() default "Developer";
    String lastModified() default "today";
}


public class AnnotationExample {

    // @Override: Compiler checks if this method actually overrides one
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "AnnotationExample Object";
    }

    // @Deprecated: Marks this method as old/discouraged
    @Deprecated
    public void oldMethod() {
        System.out.println("This method is deprecated.");
    }

    // @SuppressWarnings: Tells compiler to ignore specific warnings
    @SuppressWarnings("unused") // Suppress warning about 'unusedVariable' not being used
    public void methodWithWarning() {
        int unusedVariable;
        // ... code ...
    }

    // Using our custom annotation
    @MyInfo(createdBy = "Jane Doe", lastModified = "2023-10-27")
    public void importantMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an important method.");
    }

    // Using custom annotation with default values
    @MyInfo // Uses default values for createdBy and lastModified
    public void anotherMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is another method.");
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationExample obj = new AnnotationExample();

        System.out.println(obj.toString());

        obj.oldMethod(); // Compiler might show a warning here because it's deprecated

        obj.methodWithWarning(); // No unused variable warning because of @SuppressWarnings

        obj.importantMethod();
        obj.anotherMethod();

        // --- Example of runtime processing using Reflection (Advanced) ---
        // This part shows how frameworks *use* annotations like @MyInfo
        try {
            java.lang.reflect.Method method = AnnotationExample.class.getMethod("importantMethod");
            MyInfo annotation = method.getAnnotation(MyInfo.class); // Get the annotation object

            if (annotation != null) {
                System.out.println("\nProcessing importantMethod annotation:");
                System.out.println("  Created By: " + annotation.createdBy());
                System.out.println("  Last Modified: " + annotation.lastModified());
            }

             java.lang.reflect.Method anotherMethod = AnnotationExample.class.getMethod("anotherMethod");
             MyInfo anotherAnnotation = anotherMethod.getAnnotation(MyInfo.class);
             if (anotherAnnotation != null) {
                 System.out.println("\nProcessing anotherMethod annotation (using defaults):");
                 System.out.println("  Created By: " + anotherAnnotation.createdBy());
                 System.out.println("  Last Modified: " + anotherAnnotation.lastModified());
             }


        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** Annotations provide metadata about code. They are processed by the compiler, build tools, or at runtime via Reflection. Understand the purpose of common built-in annotations and the meta-annotations used to define custom ones.



### 15. Reflection API

**Definition:** The Java Reflection API is a powerful set of classes that allows a running Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and to manipulate its internal properties. It lets you get information about classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, without knowing their names at compile time.

**What it Allows You to Do:**

Using the Reflection API, you can:

* **Inspect Class Information:** Get the name of a class, its modifiers (public, private, static, etc.), its superclass, the interfaces it implements, and its package.
* **Inspect Members:** Get a list of constructors, methods, and fields defined in a class, including their names, types, and modifiers.
* **Access and Modify Fields:** Get or set the value of a field in an object, even if the field is private.
* **Invoke Methods:** Call a method on an object, even if the method is private, by passing arguments dynamically.
* **Create Objects:** Instantiate a new object of a class dynamically, even if you don't know the class name until runtime, using its constructors.
* **Access Annotations:** Read annotations associated with classes, methods, fields, etc., at runtime (as seen in the previous topic).

**Key Classes in `java.lang.reflect`:**

* `Class`: Represents a class or interface. It is the entry point for using Reflection. You can obtain a `Class` object using `Object.getClass()`, `ClassName.class`, or `Class.forName("fully.qualified.ClassName")`.
* `Constructor`: Represents a class constructor. Allows you to get information about a constructor and create new instances of the class using it.
* `Method`: Represents a class method. Allows you to get information about a method and invoke it on an object.
* `Field`: Represents a class field (member variable). Allows you to get information about a field and get or set its value on an object.
* `Modifier`: Provides static methods to decode the integer representation of modifiers (public, private, static, final, etc.) returned by `getModifiers()` methods in `Class`, `Field`, `Method`, and `Constructor`.

**Common Use Cases:**

Reflection is typically *not* used in standard application logic but is fundamental to many frameworks and tools:

* **Frameworks:** Dependency Injection frameworks (like Spring), ORM frameworks (like Hibernate), Web frameworks (like Jakarta EE/Spring MVC) heavily use Reflection to inspect classes, instantiate objects, inject dependencies, and call methods based on configuration or annotations.
* **Testing Frameworks:** JUnit uses Reflection to find and execute test methods (annotated with `@Test`).
* **IDEs and Debuggers:** Use Reflection to inspect the state of objects, evaluate expressions, and provide debugging information.
* **Serialization/Deserialization:** Libraries might use Reflection to inspect object structure for serialization.
* **Dynamic Proxies:** Creating implementations of interfaces or extending classes at runtime.

**Risks and Downsides:**

While powerful, Reflection should be used judiciously due to:

* **Performance Overhead:** Reflective operations are generally slower than direct method calls or field access because they involve dynamic lookups.
* **Security Restrictions:** Using Reflection to access private members can potentially bypass security restrictions imposed by the Java Security Manager. Code using Reflection often requires specific permissions.
* **Increased Complexity:** Code that uses Reflection can be harder to read, understand, and maintain because the structure and behavior are not immediately obvious from the code itself.
* **Breaks Encapsulation:** Bypassing visibility modifiers (private, protected) goes against the principles of encapsulation.
* **Compile-time Safety Lost:** Many operations (like method invocation or field access) are checked at runtime, not compile time. This means errors (like a method not existing or wrong argument types) will result in runtime exceptions (`NoSuchMethodException`, `IllegalAccessException`, `InvocationTargetException`, etc.) rather than compile-time errors.

**Example: Introspection and Manipulation using Reflection**

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.lang.reflect.Modifier;

class Person {
    private String name; // Private field
    private int age;    // Private field

    // Public constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Private method
    private void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + ", Age: " + this.age);
    }

    // Public method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Method to change age (for demonstration)
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

public class ReflectionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        try {
            // 1. Get the Class object for Person
            Class<?> personClass = Class.forName("Person"); // Use fully qualified name if in package

            System.out.println("Class Name: " + personClass.getName());
            System.out.println("Is Interface? " + personClass.isInterface());
            System.out.println("Superclass: " + personClass.getSuperclass().getName());

            System.out.println("\n--- Constructors ---");
            Constructor<?>[] constructors = personClass.getConstructors(); // Only public constructors
            for (Constructor<?> c : constructors) {
                System.out.println("Constructor: " + c.getName() + "(" + c.getParameterCount() + " params)");
            }
            Constructor<?> declaredConstructor = personClass.getDeclaredConstructor(String.class, int.class); // Any declared constructor (public, private, etc.)
            System.out.println("Declared Constructor: " + declaredConstructor.getName());


            System.out.println("\n--- Methods ---");
            Method[] publicMethods = personClass.getMethods(); // Public methods (including inherited)
            for (Method m : publicMethods) {
                System.out.println("Public Method: " + m.getName());
            }
            Method[] declaredMethods = personClass.getDeclaredMethods(); // Any declared method in this class only
            for (Method m : declaredMethods) {
                 System.out.println("Declared Method: " + m.getName() + ", Modifiers: " + Modifier.toString(m.getModifiers()));
            }


            System.out.println("\n--- Fields ---");
            Field[] publicFields = personClass.getFields(); // Only public fields (including inherited)
             System.out.println("Public Fields count: " + publicFields.length); // Likely 0 for our Person class
            Field[] declaredFields = personClass.getDeclaredFields(); // Any declared field in this class only
            for (Field f : declaredFields) {
                System.out.println("Declared Field: " + f.getName() + ", Type: " + f.getType().getName() + ", Modifiers: " + Modifier.toString(f.getModifiers()));
            }

            System.out.println("\n--- Creating Object and Manipulating ---");

            // 2. Create an instance using Reflection (using the declared constructor)
            // Need to make it accessible if it's private
            declaredConstructor.setAccessible(true); // Bypassing private access!
            Object personObject = declaredConstructor.newInstance("Alice", 30);
            System.out.println("Object created: " + personObject); // toString() is inherited from Object

            // 3. Access and modify a private field
            Field nameField = personClass.getDeclaredField("name");
            nameField.setAccessible(true); // Bypassing private access!
            String currentName = (String) nameField.get(personObject);
            System.out.println("Current name (via Reflection): " + currentName);
            nameField.set(personObject, "Bob");
            System.out.println("Name updated (via Reflection).");

            // 4. Invoke a private method
            Method displayMethod = personClass.getDeclaredMethod("displayInfo");
            displayMethod.setAccessible(true); // Bypassing private access!
            displayMethod.invoke(personObject); // Invoke the method on the personObject instance


        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Catching a broad Exception to cover various reflection errors
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway:** The Reflection API allows dynamic inspection and manipulation of Java code elements at runtime. Understand the core classes (`Class`, `Constructor`, `Method`, `Field`) and its common use cases, but also be aware of the performance, security, and complexity implications.



### 16. Java Memory Model (JVM Memory Structure & Concurrency Aspects)

**Definition:** The Java Memory Model (JMM) has two related aspects:
1.  **JVM Memory Structure:** Defines the runtime data areas that the Java Virtual Machine organizes memory into when executing a Java program.
2.  **Concurrency Model:** Specifies how threads interact through memory – specifically, how changes made by one thread are visible to other threads, and how instruction reordering is constrained.

We'll start by explaining the structure first.

**JVM Runtime Data Areas (Memory Structure):**

The JVM divides memory into several areas upon startup.

1.  **Heap:**
    * **Nature:** **Shared** across all threads in the JVM.
    * **Contents:** Stores all objects, arrays, and instance variables.
    * **Garbage Collection:** This is the area where the Garbage Collector primarily operates, reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable by the program.
    * **Lifecycle:** Created when the JVM starts, destroyed when the JVM exits.

2.  **Method Area (often called Metaspace in modern JVMs like HotSpot):**
    * **Nature:** **Shared** across all threads.
    * **Contents:** Stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors.
    * **Lifecycle:** Created when the JVM starts, destroyed when the JVM exits. In HotSpot's Metaspace (Java 8+), class metadata is stored in native memory, leading to less frequent `OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space` and more `OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`.

3.  **JVM Stacks:**
    * **Nature:** **One per thread**. Each thread has its own private JVM Stack.
    * **Contents:** Stores **Stack Frames**. Each method invocation by a thread creates a new Stack Frame and pushes it onto that thread's stack. A Stack Frame contains:
        * **Local Variables:** Variables declared within the method.
        * **Operand Stack:** Used for performing calculations and holding intermediate results.
        * **Frame Data:** Includes return address, references to the method's constant pool, etc.
    * **Lifecycle:** A stack frame is pushed when a method is invoked and popped when the method completes (either normally or by throwing an exception). The stack is created when the thread is created and destroyed when the thread exits.

4.  **PC (Program Counter) Register:**
    * **Nature:** **One per thread**.
    * **Contents:** Stores the address of the JVM instruction currently being executed by the thread. If the method is native, the value is undefined.
    * **Lifecycle:** Created when the thread is created, destroyed when the thread exits.

5.  **Native Method Stacks:**
    * **Nature:** **One per thread** (optional).
    * **Contents:** Similar to JVM Stacks, but used for native methods (methods written in languages other than Java, typically C/C++, invoked via JNI).
    * **Lifecycle:** Created when the thread is created, destroyed when the thread exits.

**Analogy:**

Imagine the JVM as a factory:

* **Heap:** The main warehouse where all the raw materials (objects) are stored. Everyone in the factory can access the warehouse. (Shared)
* **Method Area/Metaspace:** The blueprint storage room, holding instructions on how to build things (class definitions, method code). Everyone needs access to the blueprints. (Shared)
* **JVM Stacks:** Each worker (thread) has their own desk (stack) where they keep notes, tools, and materials *specifically for the task they are currently doing* (method invocation). Other workers can't see what's on your desk. (Per-thread)
* **PC Register:** A sticky note on each worker's forehead telling them which step they are on in their current task. (Per-thread)
* **Native Method Stacks:** A special desk for workers who occasionally have to use external, non-standard tools (native code). (Per-thread)

**Concurrency Aspects of the Java Memory Model (JMM Specification):**

This part of the JMM deals with how threads interact and see each other's memory changes, which is crucial for writing correct concurrent programs. It defines rules to address challenges like:

* **Visibility:** When a change made by one thread to a shared variable becomes visible to other threads.
* **Ordering:** How instruction reordering (by the compiler, processor, or cache) affects the apparent order of operations seen by other threads.

The JMM achieves this primarily through the concept of **"happens-before"** relationships. If action A *happens-before* action B, then the effects of A are visible to B, and A is ordered before B. Key happens-before relationships are established by:

* Starting a thread happens-before any action in the started thread.
* An action in one thread happens-before an action in another thread that detects that the first thread has terminated.
* Unlocking a monitor (e.g., exiting a `synchronized` block) happens-before a subsequent lock of the same monitor by another thread.
* A write to a `volatile` variable happens-before any subsequent read of that same `volatile` variable.
* A write happens-before a subsequent read if the write is ordered before the read by program order within a single thread.

Understanding happens-before is critical for using synchronization mechanisms (`synchronized`, `volatile`, `Lock`s from `java.util.concurrent`) correctly to ensure data visibility and prevent unexpected behavior in multithreaded applications.

**Key Takeaway:** The JVM memory is structured into shared areas (Heap, Method Area/Metaspace) and per-thread areas (JVM Stack, PC Register, Native Method Stack). The Java Memory Model (JMM) also defines rules, particularly "happens-before" relationships, to govern how threads interact with shared memory, ensuring visibility and ordering in concurrent programming.




### 17. Garbage Collection

**Definition:** Garbage Collection is the automatic process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reclaims memory that is no longer being used by the program. When objects are created, they occupy space on the Heap. GC automatically identifies objects that are no longer "reachable" by the running program and frees up the memory they occupy, making it available for new objects.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of GC is to provide automatic memory management, relieving the developer from the burden of explicitly allocating and deallocating memory. This prevents common memory-related errors like memory leaks (where unused memory isn't released) and dangling pointers (pointers to memory that has been freed).

**How it Works (High Level):**

GC typically works in cycles. The core idea is to determine which objects are "live" (still in use) and which are "dead" (no longer reachable). Dead objects are considered garbage and their memory is reclaimed.

The process generally involves:

1.  **Marking:** The GC identifies all objects that are reachable from a set of "garbage collection roots".
2.  **Deletion (or Sweeping):** The GC then removes the unreachable (garbage) objects.
3.  **Compacting (Optional):** After deletion, the remaining live objects might be moved around in memory to reduce fragmentation (creating contiguous free space).

**Key Concepts:**

* **Heap:** Garbage Collection primarily operates on the Heap memory area, where all Java objects reside.
* **Object Reachability:** An object is considered "reachable" (and thus "live") if it can be accessed by the application code. This is determined by starting from a set of **GC Roots**.
    * **GC Roots:** These are special objects that are always considered live, such as:
        * Local variables and parameters in the currently executing methods (in the JVM Stacks).
        * Active threads.
        * Static variables of loaded classes (in the Method Area/Metaspace).
        * References from JNI (Java Native Interface) native code.
    * An object is reachable if there is a path of references from a GC Root to the object.
    * An object is unreachable if there is no path of references from any GC Root.

```java
// Example of Reachability
Object root1 = new Object(); // root1 is a GC Root (local variable) -> Object 1 is reachable

Object obj2 = new Object(); // obj2 is a GC Root -> Object 2 is reachable

root1 = null; // Object 1 is now unreachable if no other roots point to it.
              // It becomes eligible for garbage collection.

Object obj3 = new Object();
Object obj4 = obj3; // Both obj3 (root) and obj4 point to Object 3 -> Object 3 is reachable

obj3 = null; // obj4 still points to Object 3, so Object 3 is still reachable

obj4 = null; // Now Object 3 is unreachable and eligible for GC.
```

* **Generational Hypothesis:** Most JVMs implement a generational garbage collection strategy based on the observation that:
    * Most objects are short-lived.
    * A few objects are very long-lived.
    * This leads to dividing the Heap into different generations (or pools):
        * **Young Generation:** Where new objects are initially allocated. It's further divided into Eden Space and two Survivor Spaces. Short-lived objects are created and quickly become unreachable here.
        * **Old Generation (or Tenured Generation):** Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation are promoted (or "tenured") to the Old Generation. This area contains longer-lived objects.
        * **Permanent Generation (PermGen - pre-Java 8) / Metaspace (Java 8+):** This area stores per-class metadata (like class definitions, method code, constant pool). While technically part of the GC scope, it's handled differently than the object heap. Metaspace in Java 8+ lives in native memory.

* **GC Cycles:**
    * **Minor GC (or Young GC):** Runs frequently in the Young Generation. It collects garbage from Eden and Survivor spaces. It's usually fast as most objects in the Young Gen are garbage. Surviving objects are moved between Survivor spaces or promoted to the Old Gen.
    * **Major GC:** Collects garbage from the Old Generation. This is less frequent than Minor GC but typically takes longer as the Old Gen is larger and contains more live objects.
    * **Full GC:** Collects garbage from *all* generations (Young, Old, and sometimes Metaspace/PermGen). This is the most time-consuming type of GC and can cause significant application pauses. Modern garbage collectors aim to minimize or eliminate Full GC.

* **Garbage Collectors (Algorithms):** Different JVMs offer various GC algorithms, each with trade-offs in terms of throughput (how much work the application does vs. GC work) and pause times (how long the application is stopped for GC). Some common ones:
    * **Serial GC:** Simplest, single-threaded. Suitable for small applications or single-processor machines. Stops all application threads ("stop-the-world" pause).
    * **Parallel GC (Throughput Collector):** Default in many JVMs. Uses multiple threads for Young and Old generation collection. Still involves stop-the-world pauses but is faster than Serial on multiprocessors. Prioritizes throughput.
    * **CMS GC (Concurrent Mark-Sweep):** Tries to minimize stop-the-world pauses by doing most of the collection work concurrently with application threads. Can suffer from fragmentation and concurrent mode failures. Deprecated/removed in recent Java versions.
    * **G1 GC (Garbage-First):** Designed for large multi-processor machines with large memory. Divides the heap into regions and collects garbage in regions with the most garbage first ("Garbage-First"). Aims for predictable pause times. Became the default collector in Java 9+.
    * **ZGC, Shenandoah (Modern Low-Pause Collectors):** Designed for very low pause times, often milliseconds or less, even on very large heaps. Trade-offs include higher CPU usage or reduced throughput compared to Parallel GC. (Experimental or commercial in some earlier Java versions, becoming standard later).

**Developer Interaction with GC:**

Developers generally do *not* explicitly control garbage collection in Java. You cannot force GC to run or specify when an object should be collected.

* `System.gc()` and `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()`: These are merely *hints* to the JVM that it *might* be a good time to run garbage collection. The JVM is free to ignore these hints. Relying on them is bad practice.
* Making Objects Eligible: The only way a developer influences GC is by ensuring objects become unreachable (e.g., by setting references to `null`, allowing local variables to go out of scope).

**GC Pauses:**

Garbage collection often requires stopping the application threads temporarily to perform critical tasks like marking live objects accurately. These are called "stop-the-world" pauses. The duration and frequency of these pauses are a key characteristic distinguishing different GC algorithms. Modern collectors focus heavily on reducing or eliminating these pauses.

**Key Takeaway:** GC is Java's automatic memory manager, freeing memory occupied by unreachable objects on the Heap. It works by identifying reachable objects from GC Roots. JVMs typically use generational GC. Different GC algorithms offer trade-offs between throughput and pause times. Developers don't control GC directly but make objects eligible for collection by removing references.




### 18. String Pool

**Definition:** The String Pool (also known as the String Constant Pool or String Intern Pool) is a special area in the JVM's Heap memory where String literals are stored. It's an optimization technique to save memory by storing only one copy of each unique String literal.

**Where it Exists:**

The String Pool resides within the **Heap** memory area of the JVM. (Note: In older Java versions, it was sometimes associated with the Permanent Generation/PermGen, but since Java 7+, it's definitely part of the Heap).

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of the String Pool is **memory optimization**. Since String objects are immutable (their value cannot be changed after creation), multiple parts of your program can safely share a single instance of a String with the same content, rather than each having its own separate copy.

**How String Literals vs. `new String()` Interact with the Pool:**

There are two main ways to create String objects, and they behave differently regarding the String Pool:

1.  **Using String Literals (e.g., `"hello"`):**
    * When you create a String using a literal, the JVM first checks if a String with the same content already exists in the String Pool.
    * If it exists, a reference to the existing object in the pool is returned.
    * If it doesn't exist, a *new* String object is created in the Heap, that object's reference is added to the String Pool, and a reference to this new pooled object is returned.

    ```java
    String s1 = "hello"; // Creates "hello" in the pool if it doesn't exist, returns reference to it.
    String s2 = "hello"; // Finds "hello" in the pool, returns reference to the *same* object.
    ```

2.  **Using the `new String()` Constructor (e.g., `new String("world")`):**
    * When you use the `new` keyword, a *new* String object is *always* created in the Heap memory, *outside* of the String Pool.
    * If the literal argument (e.g., `"world"`) was used, that literal might also be in the pool, but the object created by `new` is distinct.

    ```java
    String s3 = new String("world"); // Creates a *new* "world" object in the Heap (outside the pool).
                                     // The literal "world" might also be in the pool.
    String s4 = new String("world"); // Creates *another* *new* "world" object in the Heap (outside the pool).
    ```

**The `intern()` Method:**

* The `intern()` method is available on String objects.
* When called on a String, it checks if a String with the same content already exists in the String Pool.
* If it exists, it returns the reference to the pooled String object.
* If it doesn't exist, the String object itself is added to the pool, and a reference to this object is returned.
* This is often used to explicitly add Strings created via `new` to the pool or to get the pooled version of a String.

```java
String s5 = new String("java"); // Creates "java" outside the pool.
String s6 = s5.intern();        // "java" is added to the pool (if not there), s6 now refers to the pooled object.
String s7 = "java";             // s7 refers to the pooled object (same as s6).

System.out.println(s5 == s6); // false (s5 is outside pool, s6 is inside pool)
System.out.println(s6 == s7); // true (both s6 and s7 refer to the pooled object)
```

**Example Demonstrating `==` vs. `equals()` and `intern()`:**

```java
public class StringPoolExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Created using literals - JVM uses the pool
        String literal1 = "programming";
        String literal2 = "programming";

        System.out.println("Literals:");
        System.out.println("literal1 == literal2: " + (literal1 == literal2)); // true (Same object from the pool)
        System.out.println("literal1.equals(literal2): " + literal1.equals(literal2)); // true (Same content)

        System.out.println("\n---");

        // Created using new keyword - New object in Heap
        String newString1 = new String("java");
        String newString2 = new String("java");

        System.out.println("New Strings:");
        System.out.println("newString1 == newString2: " + (newString1 == newString2)); // false (Different objects in Heap)
        System.out.println("newString1.equals(newString2): " + newString1.equals(newString2)); // true (Same content)

        System.out.println("\n---");

        // Comparing literal and new String
        String literal3 = "example";
        String newString3 = new String("example");

        System.out.println("Literal vs New String:");
        System.out.println("literal3 == newString3: " + (literal3 == newString3)); // false (Different objects)
        System.out.println("literal3.equals(newString3): " + literal3.equals(newString3)); // true (Same content)

        System.out.println("\n---");

        // Using intern()
        String newString4 = new String("interned");
        String pooledString = newString4.intern(); // Adds "interned" to the pool if not there, returns pooled object

        String literal4 = "interned"; // Refers to the pooled object

        System.out.println("Using intern():");
        System.out.println("newString4 == pooledString: " + (newString4 == pooledString)); // false (newString4 is outside pool)
        System.out.println("pooledString == literal4: " + (pooledString == literal4)); // true (Both refer to the pooled object)
        System.out.println("newString4.equals(literal4): " + newString4.equals(literal4)); // true (Same content)
    }
}
```
**Output of the Example:**
```
Literals:
literal1 == literal2: true
literal1.equals(literal2): true

---
New Strings:
newString1 == newString2: false
newString1.equals(newString2): true

---
Literal vs New String:
literal3 == newString3: false
literal3.equals(newString3): true

---
Using intern():
newString4 == pooledString: false
pooledString == literal4: true
newString4.equals(literal4): true
```

**Key Takeaway:** The String Pool is a Heap area for optimizing memory by reusing String literals. String literals (`"abc"`) go into the pool, while `new String("abc")` always creates a new object outside the pool. Use `==` to check if two references point to the *exact same object* (often used to check if something is from the pool), and `equals()` to check if two Strings have the *same character content*. `intern()` can be used to explicitly get the pooled instance of a String.



### 19. Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing/Unboxing

**Definition:** Wrapper classes in Java provide a way to use primitive data types (like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) as objects. For each primitive type, there is a corresponding wrapper class in the `java.lang` package.

**Primitive Types and Their Wrapper Classes:**

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| `boolean`      | `Boolean`     |
| `char`         | `Character`   |
| `byte`         | `Byte`        |
| `short`        | `Short`       |
| `int`          | `Integer`     |
| `long`         | `Long`        |
| `float`        | `Float`       |
| `double`       | `Double`      |

**Why are Wrapper Classes Needed?**

Primitive types are not objects. However, many Java APIs and data structures require objects. Wrapper classes bridge this gap:

* **Collections Framework:** All classes in the Collections Framework (like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`) store objects. You cannot directly store primitive types in them. You must use their wrapper class equivalents (e.g., `ArrayList<Integer>` instead of `ArrayList<int>`).
* **Nullable Values:** Primitive types cannot be `null`. Wrapper classes can be `null`, which is useful in many scenarios (e.g., representing the absence of a value, working with database results that might be null).
* **Methods:** Wrapper classes provide useful methods for converting between types, parsing strings, and comparing values (e.g., `Integer.parseInt("123")`, `Double.parseDouble("3.14")`, `Boolean.valueOf("true")`).
* **Generics:** Type parameters in generics must be reference types (objects), not primitive types (e.g., `List<Integer>`, not `List<int>`).

**Autoboxing (Java 5+):**

* **Definition:** The automatic conversion by the Java compiler from a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class object.
* This simplifies code, as you don't have to manually create wrapper objects using constructors or `valueOf()` methods.

```java
int primitiveInt = 10;
// Manual boxing (before Autoboxing)
// Integer wrapperInt = new Integer(primitiveInt); // Or Integer.valueOf(primitiveInt);

// Autoboxing: int is automatically converted to Integer
Integer wrapperInt = primitiveInt; // Compiler does Integer.valueOf(primitiveInt); behind the scenes

List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>();
integerList.add(20); // Autoboxing: int 20 is converted to Integer object
```

**Unboxing (Java 5+):**

* **Definition:** The automatic conversion by the Java compiler from a wrapper class object to its corresponding primitive type.
* This simplifies code when you need to use a wrapper object in a context where a primitive is expected (like arithmetic operations).

```java
Integer wrapperValue = 100; // Autoboxing happened here

// Manual unboxing (before Unboxing)
// int primitiveValue = wrapperValue.intValue();

// Unboxing: Integer object is automatically converted to int
int primitiveValue = wrapperValue; // Compiler does wrapperValue.intValue(); behind the scenes

Integer sumWrapper = 50;
int sum = sumWrapper + 10; // Unboxing: sumWrapper is converted to int for the addition
```

**Examples Combining Autoboxing and Unboxing:**

```java
public class AutoboxingUnboxingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Autoboxing: primitive to wrapper
        Integer autoBoxedInt = 5;
        Double autoBoxedDouble = 3.14;
        Boolean autoBoxedBoolean = true;

        System.out.println("Autoboxed Integer: " + autoBoxedInt);
        System.out.println("Autoboxed Double: " + autoBoxedDouble);
        System.out.println("Autoboxed Boolean: " + autoBoxedBoolean);

        // Unboxing: wrapper to primitive
        int unboxedInt = autoBoxedInt; // Unboxing
        double unboxedDouble = autoBoxedDouble; // Unboxing
        boolean unboxedBoolean = autoBoxedBoolean; // Unboxing

        System.out.println("\nUnboxed int: " + unboxedInt);
        System.out.println("Unboxed double: " + unboxedDouble);
        System.out.println("Unboxed boolean: " + unboxedBoolean);

        // Using autoboxing/unboxing in expressions/method calls
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(1); // Autoboxing int to Integer
        numbers.add(2); // Autoboxing int to Integer
        int firstNum = numbers.get(0); // Unboxing Integer to int

        System.out.println("\nList element (unboxed): " + firstNum);

        Integer num1 = 10;
        Integer num2 = 20;
        Integer sum = num1 + num2; // Unboxing num1 and num2 for addition, then Autoboxing the result back to Integer
        System.out.println("Sum using wrapper objects: " + sum); // Prints 30
    }
}
```

**Potential Issues (NullPointerException with Autoboxing):**

One common pitfall with autoboxing is when you try to unbox a wrapper object that is `null`. This will result in a `NullPointerException` at runtime.

```java
Integer nullableInt = null;
// int primitiveInt = nullableInt; // CAUTION: This will throw NullPointerException!

if (nullableInt != null) {
    int primitiveInt = nullableInt; // This is safe now
    System.out.println("Unboxed nullableInt: " + primitiveInt);
} else {
    System.out.println("nullableInt is null. Cannot unbox.");
}
```
Always check for `null` before unboxing if there's a possibility the wrapper object reference might be null.

**Key Takeaway:** Wrapper classes allow primitive types to be used as objects, necessary for collections and other object-oriented contexts. Autoboxing and Unboxing are convenient compiler features that automate the conversion between primitives and their wrappers, but be mindful of potential `NullPointerException` when unboxing `null` references.



### 20. Access Modifiers

**Definition:** Access modifiers are keywords in Java that set the accessibility (visibility) level of classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields. They determine from where these elements can be accessed in your code.

**The Four Access Modifiers:**

From most restrictive to least restrictive:

1.  `private`:
    * **Visibility:** Accessible *only within the same class* where it is declared.
2.  `default` (or package-private):
    * **Visibility:** Accessible *only within the same package*. If no access modifier is specified for a member or class, it is `default`.
3.  `protected`:
    * **Visibility:** Accessible within the *same package* **and** by *subclasses* (even if the subclasses are in a different package).
4.  `public`:
    * **Visibility:** Accessible from *anywhere*. This is the least restrictive level.

**Summary Table of Access Levels:**

| Modifier    | Within same Class | Within same Package | By Subclasses (any package) | From anywhere (any package) |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `private`   | Yes               | No                  | No                          | No                          |
| `default`   | Yes               | Yes                 | No                          | No                          |
| `protected` | Yes               | Yes                 | Yes                         | No                          |
| `public`    | Yes               | Yes                 | Yes                         | Yes                         |

**Access Modifiers for Top-Level Classes:**

* Top-level classes (classes not nested inside another class) can only have two access modifiers:
    * `public`: The class is accessible from any other class in any package.
    * `default` (no keyword): The class is accessible only from classes within the same package.
* `private` and `protected` are *not* allowed for top-level classes.

**Example Demonstrating Access Levels:**

Let's imagine two packages: `com.example.package1` and `com.example.package2`.

**Package: `com.example.package1`**

```java
// File: com/example/package1/ParentClass.java
package com.example.package1;

public class ParentClass { // public class, accessible from anywhere

    private int privateVar = 10; // Only accessible within ParentClass
    int defaultVar = 20;         // Accessible within package1
    protected int protectedVar = 30; // Accessible within package1 and by subclasses
    public int publicVar = 40;   // Accessible from anywhere

    private ParentClass() { // Private constructor
        System.out.println("Private ParentClass constructor called.");
    }

    public ParentClass(String message) { // Public constructor
         System.out.println("Public ParentClass constructor called with: " + message);
    }

    private void privateMethod() { // Private method
        System.out.println("Inside privateMethod");
    }

    void defaultMethod() { // Default method
        System.out.println("Inside defaultMethod (package1)");
    }

    protected void protectedMethod() { // Protected method
        System.out.println("Inside protectedMethod (package1)");
    }

    }
}
```

*(To fully test this example, you would need to set up a project with the correct package structure and compile/run it, observing the compile-time errors or runtime behavior based on access.)*

**Key Takeaway:** Access modifiers control visibility. `private` is within the class, `default` is within the package, `protected` is within the package and by subclasses, and `public` is everywhere. Choose the most restrictive modifier that allows the necessary access to promote encapsulation. Top-level classes can only be `public` or `default`.




### 21. `static` Keyword

**Definition:** The `static` keyword in Java is used to declare members (fields or methods) or blocks that belong to the *class itself*, rather than to any specific *instance* of the class.

**Key Characteristic:**

When a member is declared `static`, you can access it directly using the class name, without needing to create an object (an instance) of the class. There is only *one* copy of a static member, shared among all instances of that class.

**Applying `static`:**

1.  **Static Fields (Class Variables):**
    * Belongs to the class, shared by all instances.
    * Initialized when the class is loaded.
    * Good for constants (`public static final`) or variables that track a class-wide state (like a counter for the number of objects created).

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        static int count = 0; // Shared by all MyClass objects
        // ...
    }
    // Access: int currentCount = MyClass.count;
    ```

2.  **Static Methods:**
    * Belongs to the class.
    * Can be called using the class name (`ClassName.methodName()`).
    * **Crucial restriction:** Static methods can *only* directly access other static members (fields or methods) of the same class. They *cannot* directly access instance fields or instance methods because they are not associated with a specific object instance.
    * Useful for utility functions that don't need to operate on specific object data (e.g., `Math.max()`, `Arrays.sort()`).

    ```java
    public class Calculator {
        public static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    // Call: int sum = Calculator.add(5, 3); // No object needed
    ```

3.  **Static Blocks (Static Initializer Blocks):**
    * A block of code within a class, marked with the `static` keyword.
    * Executes *once* when the class is first loaded into the JVM.
    * Used for initializing static fields that require more complex logic than a simple assignment.

    ```java
    public class AppConfig {
        static String DB_URL;
        static { // Static block
            // Complex logic to determine DB_URL
            DB_URL = System.getenv("DATABASE_URL") != null ?
                     System.getenv("DATABASE_URL") : "jdbc:default";
            System.out.println("Static block executed, DB_URL initialized.");
        }
        // ...
    }
    // The static block runs when AppConfig is first referenced/loaded.
    ```

4.  **Static Nested Classes:**
    * A class declared inside another class, marked with `static`.
    * **Key difference from Inner Classes:** Static nested classes do *not* have an implicit reference to the instance of the outer class. They can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.
    * Can only directly access static members of the outer class (just like static methods).

    ```java
    public class Outer {
        static int outerStaticVar = 10;
        int outerInstanceVar = 20; // Cannot access directly from StaticNestedClass

        public static class StaticNestedClass {
            public void display() {
                System.out.println("Outer static var: " + outerStaticVar); // OK
                // System.out.println("Outer instance var: " + outerInstanceVar); // Compile-time error
            }
        }
    }
    // Instantiation: Outer.StaticNestedClass nested = new Outer.StaticNestedClass();
    ```

**Simple Example:**

```java
public class Counter {
    // Static field: belongs to the Counter class, shared by all instances
    private static int instanceCount = 0;

    // Instance field: belongs to each individual Counter object
    private int id;

    // Constructor
    public Counter() {
        // Increment the static counter every time a new instance is created
        instanceCount++;
        this.id = instanceCount; // Assign a unique ID based on creation order
        System.out.println("Counter instance " + this.id + " created.");
    }

    // Static method: belongs to the class
    public static int getInstanceCount() {
        // Can access static fields
        return instanceCount;
    }

    // Instance method: belongs to an object
    public int getId() {
        // Can access instance fields AND static fields
        return this.id;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing static field directly via class name
        System.out.println("Initial instance count: " + Counter.getInstanceCount()); // 0

        Counter c1 = new Counter(); // instanceCount becomes 1
        Counter c2 = new Counter(); // instanceCount becomes 2
        Counter c3 = new Counter(); // instanceCount becomes 3

        // Accessing static method via class name
        System.out.println("Final instance count: " + Counter.getInstanceCount()); // 3

        // Accessing instance fields/methods via object references
        System.out.println("c1 ID: " + c1.getId()); // 1
        System.out.println("c2 ID: " + c2.getId()); // 2
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* `static` members belong to the *class*, not an *object*.
* There's only *one* copy of a static field.
* Static methods *cannot* access instance members directly.
* Used for class-level data/operations (utilities, constants, shared state).



### 22. `final` Keyword

**Definition:** The `final` keyword in Java is used to declare an entity that can only be assigned once. It essentially makes something "read-only" after its initial assignment or initialization.

**Applying `final`:**

The `final` keyword can be applied to:

1.  **Variables (Fields and Local Variables):**
    * **Meaning:** A `final` variable can only be initialized *once*. After initialization, its value cannot be changed (reassigned).
    * For primitive types, the value itself is constant.
    * For object references, the *reference* is constant. This means the variable will always point to the *same object* in memory. However, the *state* (fields) of the object that the `final` reference points to *can* still be modified (unless the object itself is immutable).

    ```java
    final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
    // MAX_VALUE = 200; // Compile-time error

    final List<String> COLORS = new ArrayList<>();
    COLORS.add("Red"); // OK - modifying the state of the object
    // COLORS = new ArrayList<>(); // Compile-time error - cannot reassign the reference
    ```
    * `final` instance variables must be initialized either at the point of declaration or in the constructor.
    * `final` static variables must be initialized either at the point of declaration or in a static initializer block.

2.  **Methods:**
    * **Meaning:** A `final` method in a superclass cannot be overridden by subclasses.
    * Used when you want to ensure that the implementation of a method remains consistent across all subclasses and cannot be altered.

    ```java
    class Parent {
        public final void cannotOverride() {
            System.out.println("This method cannot be overridden.");
        }

        public void canOverride() {
             System.out.println("This method can be overridden.");
        }
    }

    class Child extends Parent {
        // @Override // Compile-time error if uncommented
        // public void cannotOverride() { }

        @Override // OK
        public void canOverride() {
            System.out.println("Child's overridden method.");
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Classes:**
    * **Meaning:** A `final` class cannot be subclassed (extended) by any other class.
    * Used when you want to prevent inheritance, often for security reasons (ensuring the class's behavior cannot be tampered with by malicious subclasses) or design reasons (ensuring a class's implementation is complete and should not be extended).
    * Example: `java.lang.String` is a `final` class.

    ```java
    final class ImmutableClass {
        private final int value; // final field (value cannot be changed)

        public ImmutableClass(int value) {
            this.value = value; // Initialize final field
        }

        public int getValue() {
            return value;
        }
    }

    // class AttemptToExtend extends ImmutableClass { // Compile-time error - cannot extend a final class
    //     // ...
    // }
    ```

**Simple Example:**

```java
// Final Class
final class Animal { // Cannot be extended
    private final String species; // Final field

    public Animal(String species) {
        this.species = species;
    }

    // Final method
    public final void sleep() { // Cannot be overridden
        System.out.println(species + " is sleeping.");
    }

    // Getter for the final field
    public String getSpecies() {
        return species;
    }
}

// class Dog extends Animal { // Compile-time error because Animal is final
//    public Dog() {
//        super("Dog");
//    }
//    // Cannot override sleep() because it's final
// }


public class FinalKeywordExample {

    // Static final field (Constant)
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;

    // Final instance field, initialized in constructor
    private final int instanceId;

    public FinalKeywordExample(int id) {
        this.instanceId = id;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Final local primitive variable
        final int maxAttempts = 3;
        // maxAttempts = 5; // Compile-time error

        // Final local object reference
        final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" World"); // OK - modifying the object's state
        System.out.println(sb); // Prints "Hello World"
        // sb = new StringBuilder("Another"); // Compile-time error - cannot reassign the reference

        System.out.println("PI value: " + FinalKeywordExample.PI); // Accessing static final field
        // FinalKeywordExample.PI = 3.1; // Compile-time error

        FinalKeywordExample example = new FinalKeywordExample(101);
        System.out.println("Instance ID: " + example.instanceId);
        // example.instanceId = 102; // Compile-time error

        Animal myAnimal = new Animal("Lion"); // Cannot be extended
        myAnimal.sleep(); // Calls the final method
        System.out.println("Animal species: " + myAnimal.getSpecies());
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* `final` means "assignable once".
* Applied to variables: cannot reassign the variable (value for primitives, reference for objects).
* Applied to methods: cannot be overridden by subclasses.
* Applied to classes: cannot be subclassed.
* Used for constants, preventing method modification, and preventing inheritance.




### 23. Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

Both abstract classes and interfaces are mechanisms in Java for achieving abstraction and polymorphism, but they serve slightly different purposes and have key differences.

**Abstract Class:**

* **Definition:** A class that cannot be instantiated directly (you cannot create an object of an abstract class using `new`).
* **Purpose:** To provide a common base class for related subclasses, defining some common behavior (concrete methods) and declaring some behavior that subclasses *must* implement (abstract methods). It represents an "is-a" relationship where subclasses are specialized versions of the abstract class.
* Declared using the `abstract` keyword.

**Interface:**

* **Definition:** A contract that defines a set of methods that a class implementing the interface *must* provide implementations for.
* **Purpose:** To define a capability or role that classes can fulfill, regardless of their position in the class hierarchy. It represents a "has-a capability" or "can-do" relationship.
* Declared using the `interface` keyword.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature             | Abstract Class                                     | Interface                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Instantiation** | Cannot be instantiated (`new AbstractClass()`)     | Cannot be instantiated (`new Interface()`)                                |
| **What it Contains**| - Variables (instance and static)                  | - Constants (`public static final` - implicitly)                          |
|                     | - Constructors                                     | - Abstract methods (`public abstract` - implicitly before Java 8)         |
|                     | - Concrete (regular) methods                       | - Default methods (Java 8+)                                               |
|                     | - Abstract methods                                 | - Static methods (Java 8+)                                                |
|                     | - Nested classes/interfaces                        | - Private methods (Java 9+)                                               |
| **Inheritance/ Implementation** | A class `extends` an abstract class.   | A class `implements` an interface.                                        |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | A class can only extend **one** abstract class. | A class can `implement` **multiple** interfaces. (Java supports multiple inheritance of *type*, not implementation, via interfaces) |
| **Constructors** | Can have constructors (called by subclasses)       | Cannot have constructors                                                  |
| **State (Instance Variables)** | Can declare and use instance variables | Cannot declare instance variables (only `public static final` constants) |
| **Access Modifiers**| Members (fields, methods) can have any access modifier (`public`, `protected`, `default`, `private`) | Members are implicitly `public` (constants are `public static final`, methods are `public abstract`, default/static/private methods have their explicit modifiers). |
| **Completeness** | Can have both complete (concrete) and incomplete (abstract) methods. | Before Java 8, could only have abstract methods. Since Java 8, can have default and static concrete methods. |

**When to Use Which:**

* **Use an Abstract Class when:**
    * You have a strong "is-a" relationship (e.g., `Car` is a `Vehicle`).
    * You want to provide a common base implementation (concrete methods and fields) while leaving some methods for subclasses to define.
    * You need to define non-public members or instance state that all subclasses share.
    * You want to define constructors to enforce common initialization logic for subclasses.
* **Use an Interface when:**
    * You define a contract for behavior that different, potentially unrelated classes can fulfill (e.g., `Dog` `implements` `Runnable`, `Car` `implements` `Runnable`). It's about capability ("can run").
    * You want to achieve multiple inheritance of type.
    * You want to define constants shared by a group of classes that use this contract.
    * You need to add new functionality to existing classes without forcing them into a specific inheritance hierarchy (default methods in Java 8+).

**Simple Examples:**

**Abstract Class Example:**

```java
abstract class Shape { // Cannot create a Shape object

    protected String color; // Instance variable

    public Shape(String color) { // Constructor
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Concrete method
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    // Abstract method - subclasses MUST implement this
    public abstract double getArea();

    // Concrete method
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a " + color + " shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape { // Extends abstract class

    private double radius;

    public Circle(String color, double radius) {
        super(color); // Call abstract class constructor
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea() { // Must implement abstract method
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

**Interface Example:**

```java
interface Flyable { // Defines a capability

    // Constant (implicitly public static final)
    int MAX_ALTITUDE = 10000;

    // Abstract method (implicitly public abstract)
    void fly();

    // Default method (Java 8+)
    default void land() {
        System.out.println("Landing...");
    }

    // Static method (Java 8+)
    static void reportMaxAltitude() {
        System.out.println("Maximum altitude: " + MAX_ALTITUDE + " feet.");
    }
}

class Bird implements Flyable { // Implements interface

    @Override
    public void fly() { // Must implement abstract method
        System.out.println("Bird is flying high!");
    }
    // Can optionally override land()
}

class Airplane implements Flyable { // Implements interface

    @Override
    public void fly() { // Must implement abstract method
        System.out.println("Airplane is soaring through the sky.");
    }

    @Override
    public void land() { // Can override default method
        System.out.println("Airplane is landing on the runway.");
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* Abstract Class: "is-a", can have state and concrete methods, extend one.
* Interface: "can-do" / capability, defines a contract (mostly abstract methods before Java 8), implement many.
* Abstract classes provide a base with partial implementation; Interfaces define a pure contract (though default/static methods add some implementation capability since Java 8).



### 24. Method Overloading vs. Overriding

Both overloading and overriding deal with methods having the same name, but they apply in different contexts and achieve different forms of polymorphism.

**Method Overloading:**

* **Definition:** Occurs when a class has multiple methods with the *same name* but different *parameter lists*.
* **Purpose:** To provide methods that perform similar operations but can accept different types or numbers of arguments.
* **Location:** Happens *within the same class*.

**Method Overriding:**

* **Definition:** Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is *already defined* in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the *same signature* (name and parameter list) as the method in the superclass.
* **Purpose:** To allow subclasses to provide their own specific behavior for a method inherited from their superclass.
* **Location:** Happens across an *inheritance hierarchy* (between a superclass and a subclass).

**Key Differences:**

| Feature           | Method Overloading                                 | Method Overriding                                          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Methods with the same name, different parameters.  | Subclass provides implementation for a superclass method.    |
| **Happens In** | Within the *same class*.                           | Across *inheritance* (Superclass and Subclass).             |
| **Method Signature**| **Must be different** (different number/types/order of parameters). | **Must be the same** (same name, same number/types/order of parameters). |
| **Return Type** | Can be the same or different.                      | Must be the same or a **covariant return type** (a subtype of the superclass's return type - Java 5+). |
| **Access Modifiers**| Can be different.                                  | Cannot be more restrictive than the superclass method (e.g., if super is `public`, override must be `public`). Can be less restrictive (`protected` -> `public` is allowed). |
| **Exception Handling**| Can declare different exceptions.                  | Can only declare the same or a subtype of the exception(s) declared in the superclass method. Cannot declare new *checked* exceptions not declared by the superclass method. |
| **`final` / `static` / `private`** | Can overload methods regardless of these keywords. | - `final` methods **cannot** be overridden.                |
|                   |                                                    | - `static` methods **cannot** be overridden (can hide, but not override). |
|                   |                                                    | - `private` methods **cannot** be overridden (can hide, but not override). |
| **Binding Time** | **Compile-time** (Static Polymorphism): The compiler decides which overloaded method to call based on the arguments at compile time. | **Runtime** (Dynamic Polymorphism): The JVM decides which overridden method to call based on the actual object type at runtime. |

**Example of Method Overloading:**

```java
public class Calculator {

    // Overload 1: add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Adding two integers");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overload 2: add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
         System.out.println("Adding three integers");
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overload 3: add two doubles (different parameter types)
    public double add(double a, double b) {
         System.out.println("Adding two doubles");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overload 4: add an int and a double (different order/types)
    public double add(int a, double b) {
         System.out.println("Adding an int and a double");
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));       // Calls Overload 1
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10, 15));   // Calls Overload 2
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.5, 10.1));   // Calls Overload 3
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10.1));     // Calls Overload 4
    }
}
```

**Example of Method Overriding:**

```java
class Vehicle {
    public void drive() { // Method to be overridden
        System.out.println("Vehicle is driving.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override // Annotation is optional but recommended for clarity and compiler checks
    public void drive() { // Same signature as superclass method
        System.out.println("Car is driving on the road.");
    }
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
     @Override
     public void drive() { // Same signature as superclass method
         System.out.println("Motorcycle is cruising.");
     }
}

public class MethodOverridingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myVehicle = new Vehicle();
        Vehicle myCar = new Car(); // Polymorphism: Vehicle reference, but Car object
        Vehicle myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle(); // Vehicle reference, but Motorcycle object

        myVehicle.drive();    // Calls Vehicle's drive()
        myCar.drive();        // Calls Car's drive() - Runtime Polymorphism
        myMotorcycle.drive(); // Calls Motorcycle's drive() - Runtime Polymorphism

        Car specificCar = new Car();
        specificCar.drive();  // Calls Car's drive()
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* **Overloading:** Same method name, *different parameters*, same class, compile-time.
* **Overriding:** Same method name, *same parameters*, superclass/subclass relationship, runtime.
* Overloading is about providing convenience for callers; Overriding is about providing specific implementations in subclasses.



* **Method Overloading:** This is a form of **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism**.
* **Method Overriding & Abstract Classes/Interfaces:** This is the foundation of **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism**.

While we've seen examples, Polymorphism itself is one of the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is often asked about as a distinct concept in interviews.

So, let's briefly define and summarize it as a core principle, referencing the examples we've already covered.

### 25. Polymorphism

**Definition:** Polymorphism (meaning "many forms") is the ability of an object to take on many forms, or the ability of a reference variable to refer to objects of different types, and for methods called on that variable to behave according to the actual object type.

In simpler terms, it allows you to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way through a common superclass or interface, and the specific behavior executed depends on the actual object's class at runtime.

Java supports two main types of polymorphism:

1.  **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism / Ad-hoc Polymorphism):**
    * Achieved primarily through **Method Overloading**.
    * The compiler determines which specific method to call at compile time based on the method name and the number/types of arguments provided.
    * We saw this in the **Method Overloading** example where `calc.add()` behaved differently based on whether we passed two integers, three integers, or two doubles.

2.  **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism / Subtype Polymorphism):**
    * Achieved through **Method Overriding** and the use of inheritance or interfaces.
    * The JVM determines which specific overridden method implementation to call at runtime based on the *actual type* of the object, not the type of the reference variable.
    * This is the most common form of polymorphism in OOP.
    * We saw this in the **Method Overriding** example where a `Vehicle` reference variable could point to a `Car` or `Motorcycle` object, and calling `drive()` on that same reference variable executed the specific `drive()` method defined in `Car` or `Motorcycle`, respectively, at runtime.

**Benefits of Polymorphism:**

* **Flexibility and Extensibility:** New classes can be added without modifying existing code that uses the common superclass or interface.
* **Code Reusability:** Common code can be written to handle objects of different types.
* **Maintainability:** Makes code easier to understand and modify by focusing on the common interface or superclass rather than specific implementations.

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* Polymorphism means "many forms"; an object/reference can behave differently based on type.
* **Compile-time (Static):** Decided by the compiler, mainly via Method Overloading.
* **Runtime (Dynamic):** Decided by the JVM, via Method Overriding (using inheritance/interfaces).
* Enables writing flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.

We have already covered the specific mechanisms (Overloading, Overriding, Abstract Classes, Interfaces) that enable polymorphism. This brief topic just ties them together under the main OOP principle.




### 26. `this` vs. `super` Keywords

These keywords are used within instance methods or constructors to refer to either the current object or the immediate parent class.

**`this` Keyword:**

* **Definition:** `this` is a reference to the *current object* within an instance method or a constructor.
* **Purpose:**
    * To refer to instance variables of the current class when they are hidden by local variables or method parameters with the same name (shadowing).
    * To call another constructor of the current class (constructor chaining).
    * To pass the current object as an argument to another method.
    * To return the current object from a method.

**`super` Keyword:**

* **Definition:** `super` is a reference to the *immediate parent class* (superclass) of the current object.
* **Purpose:**
    * To access members (fields or methods) of the immediate parent class, especially when they are hidden (overridden or shadowed) by members in the current class.
    * To call the constructor of the immediate parent class (constructor chaining in inheritance).

**Key Distinctions and Uses:**

| Feature       | `this`                                            | `super`                                              |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Refers To** | The *current object* instance.                    | The *immediate parent class* of the current object.  |
| **Used For** | - Accessing current object's instance members.   | - Accessing parent class's members.                  |
|               | - Calling current class constructors (`this()`). | - Calling parent class constructors (`super()`).     |
| **Context** | Instance methods and constructors.                | Instance methods and constructors (in subclasses).   |
| **`()` Usage**| `this()` calls another constructor in *this* class. | `super()` calls a constructor in the *immediate parent* class. |
| **Requirement for `this()`/`super()`** | If used, `this()` or `super()` must be the *first statement* in a constructor. Only one can be used in a single constructor. |

**Example Demonstrating `this` and `super`:**

```java
class Vehicle {
    private String type; // Instance variable in Parent Class

    // Parent class constructor
    public Vehicle(String type) {
        // Using 'this' implicitly or explicitly for clarity
        this.type = type; // Assigning parameter 'type' to instance variable 'this.type'
        System.out.println("Vehicle constructor called. Type: " + this.type);
    }

    // Method in Parent Class
    public void displayType() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle Type: " + this.type);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private String model; // Instance variable in Child Class
    private int year;     // Instance variable in Child Class

    // Child class constructor 1
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        // Call the parent class constructor first.
        // 'super()' must be the first statement in the child constructor.
        super("Car"); // Calls Vehicle("Car")

        // Using 'this' to assign parameters to instance variables
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        System.out.println("Car constructor 1 called. Model: " + this.model);
    }

    // Child class constructor 2 (demonstrating this())
    public Car(String model, int year, String message) {
        // Call another constructor in the current class using 'this()'.
        // 'this()' must be the first statement.
        this(model, year); // Calls Car(model, year) constructor above
        System.out.println("Car constructor 2 called with message: " + message);
    }


    // Method in Child Class (overriding parent method implicitly)
    public void displayType() {
        // Calling the overridden method in the parent class using 'super'
        super.displayType(); // Calls Vehicle's displayType()

        // Accessing instance variables of the current object using 'this' implicitly
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);

        // Explicitly using 'this' for clarity (optional here)
        System.out.println("(Using this.model): " + this.model);
    }

     // Method to demonstrate passing 'this'
     public void showSelf(Car car) {
         System.out.println("Received object reference: " + car);
         System.out.println("Current object reference: " + this); // 'this' is the same reference as 'car'
     }
}


public class ThisSuperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Sedan", 2022);
        System.out.println("\nCalling displayType() on myCar:");
        myCar.displayType(); // Calls the overridden method in Car class

        System.out.println("\nCreating another car using the second constructor:");
        Car anotherCar = new Car("SUV", 2023, "Hello from constructor 2!");
        System.out.println("\nCalling displayType() on anotherCar:");
        anotherCar.displayType();

        System.out.println("\nDemonstrating passing 'this':");
        anotherCar.showSelf(anotherCar); // Passing itself as an argument
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaway for Interview:**

* `this` refers to the *current object*. Use it to access current instance members (especially when shadowed) or call current constructors (`this()`).
* `super` refers to the *immediate parent class*. Use it to access parent members (especially when overridden) or call parent constructors (`super()`).
* `this()` and `super()` must be the first statement in a constructor if used.




### 27. Exception Hierarchy (Throwable, Error, Exception, RuntimeException)

The Java exception hierarchy starts with the `Throwable` class and branches into `Error` and `Exception`.

```
java.lang.Object
   └── java.lang.Throwable
          ├── java.lang.Error     (Unchecked)
          └── java.lang.Exception (Mostly Checked)
                 └── java.lang.RuntimeException (Unchecked)
```

* **`java.lang.Throwable`:**
    * The superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java.
    * Anything that can be `throw`n in Java must be a subclass of `Throwable`.

* **`java.lang.Error`:**
    * Represents serious problems that indicate **serious system resource problems or unrecoverable conditions**.
    * Examples: `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`.
    * Applications should **not** catch Errors under normal circumstances.
    * They are **Unchecked** exceptions.

* **`java.lang.Exception`:**
    * Represents conditions that a reasonable application **might want to catch**.
    * Examples: `IOException`, `SQLException`, `ClassNotFoundException`.
    * Subclasses of `Exception` (excluding `RuntimeException` and its subclasses) are **Checked** exceptions. This means the compiler forces you to handle or declare them (`try-catch` or `throws`).

* **`java.lang.RuntimeException`:**
    * A subclass of `Exception`.
    * Represents **programming errors** or unexpected conditions that often indicate a bug.
    * Examples: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ArithmeticException`, `IllegalArgumentException`.
    * They are **Unchecked** exceptions. The compiler does **not** force you to handle or declare them.

**Checked vs. Unchecked Recap:**

* **Checked Exceptions:** Subclasses of `Exception`, *excluding* `RuntimeException`. Compiler mandates handling.
* **Unchecked Exceptions:** `Error` and `RuntimeException` and their subclasses. Compiler *does not* mandate handling.

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* `Throwable` is the root.
* `Error`: Serious, unrecoverable system problems, **Unchecked**.
* `Exception`: Conditions applications *might* handle.
    * Regular `Exception` subclasses: **Checked**.
    * `RuntimeException` subclasses: Programming errors, **Unchecked**.
* Compiler checks for `Checked` exceptions only.




### 28. JVM, JRE, JDK

These are three core components in the Java ecosystem, often confused but with distinct roles.

* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
    * **Definition:** The abstract machine or specification that defines how `.class` files (containing Java bytecode) are executed.
    * **Purpose:** It's the runtime *engine* that reads and runs the bytecode. It is platform-dependent (there's a specific JVM implementation for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).
    * **What it is:** The **runtime execution engine**. It doesn't contain any development tools or libraries on its own.

* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**
    * **Definition:** The environment required to *run* Java applications.
    * **Purpose:** It provides the necessary components for executing Java programs.
    * **What it contains:** It includes the **JVM** plus the Java standard library classes (the essential JAR files like `rt.jar` containing core classes like `String`, `System`, collections, etc.).
    * If you only need to run Java applications (not develop them), you only need the JRE.

* **JDK (Java Development Kit):**
    * **Definition:** The full-featured kit for developing Java applications.
    * **Purpose:** It provides everything needed to write, compile, debug, and run Java applications.
    * **What it contains:** It includes the **JRE** (and thus the JVM and standard libraries) plus development tools like:
        * `javac` (Java Compiler)
        * `jar` (Archiver)
        * `javadoc` (Documentation Generator)
        * `jdb` (Debugger)
        * Monitoring and troubleshooting tools, etc.
    * If you are developing Java applications, you need the JDK.

**Relationship (Think Nested Dolls):**

* **JDK ⊃ JRE ⊃ JVM**
* The JDK **contains** the JRE.
* The JRE **contains** the JVM and the standard libraries.

**Analogy:**

* **JVM:** The engine of a car. It makes the car run.
* **JRE:** The assembled car itself (with the engine, wheels, chassis, etc.). You can drive it.
* **JDK:** The entire car in your garage, plus a set of tools (wrench, screwdriver, manual) that allow you to fix, modify, or build car parts.

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* **JVM:** Runs the bytecode (the engine).
* **JRE:** Runs Java programs (JVM + standard libraries - the car).
* **JDK:** Develops Java programs (JRE + development tools - the car with tools).
* You need JDK for development, JRE just to run.




### 29. Garbage Collector Algorithms (Types)

Different GC algorithms are designed to optimize for different goals, primarily trading off between application throughput (how much work your program does) and GC pause times (how long the application is stopped for GC).

Here are some key ones:

1.  **Serial GC:**
    * **Approach:** Uses a single thread for all GC work (Young and Old generations).
    * **Characteristic:** Simple, efficient for small applications or single-processor machines. Causes "stop-the-world" pauses.

2.  **Parallel GC (Throughput Collector):**
    * **Approach:** Uses multiple threads for Young and Old generation collection.
    * **Characteristic:** Designed for high throughput (maximizing the work done by the application). Still causes stop-the-world pauses, but shorter than Serial GC on multi-core systems.

3.  **CMS GC (Concurrent Mark-Sweep):**
    * **Approach:** Tries to minimize stop-the-world pauses by doing most of the collection work concurrently with application threads.
    * **Characteristic:** Lower pause times compared to Serial/Parallel for many workloads. Can suffer from fragmentation and concurrent mode failures. (Note: Deprecated and removed in recent Java versions).

4.  **G1 GC (Garbage-First):**
    * **Approach:** Divides the heap into regions. Collects garbage in regions containing the most garbage first. Aims for a balance between throughput and pause times.
    * **Characteristic:** Designed for large heaps and multi-core processors. Provides more predictable pause times than CMS. **Default collector since Java 9.**

5.  **ZGC and Shenandoah:**
    * **Approach:** Modern, low-latency collectors that perform most of their work concurrently with application threads.
    * **Characteristic:** Designed for very low pause times (often milliseconds or less), even on very large heaps. Trade-offs can include slightly higher CPU usage.

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* Different GCs optimize for throughput vs. pause time.
* Know these types:
    * **Serial:** Single-threaded, simple.
    * **Parallel:** Multi-threaded, high throughput.
    * **CMS:** Concurrent, lower pause (deprecated).
    * **G1:** Region-based, balanced, **default**.
    * **ZGC/Shenandoah:** Modern, very low pause.




### 30. Key Java 8 Features (Fast Overview)

Java 8 brought significant changes, particularly focused on enabling functional programming style.

Here are the essential features to know:

1.  **Lambda Expressions:**
    * **What:** A concise way to represent an anonymous function (a function without a name).
    * **Why:** Enables writing more compact and readable code, especially for implementing simple interfaces or passing behavior (like with Streams).

    ```java
    // Old way
    // Runnable r = new Runnable() { public void run() { System.out.println("Running"); } };
    // Lambda equivalent
    Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Running");
    ```

2.  **Functional Interfaces:**
    * **What:** An interface with exactly one abstract method (Single Abstract Method - SAM).
    * **Why:** Serve as target types for Lambda Expressions. Java has built-in ones (`Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, etc.) and new ones in `java.util.function` (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`).
    * Can be marked with `@FunctionalInterface` annotation (optional, helps compiler check).

    ```java
    @FunctionalInterface
    interface MyFunction {
        void doSomething();
        // Cannot have another abstract method here
    }
    ```

3.  **Stream API (`java.util.stream`):**
    * **What:** A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. Not a data structure itself, but a way to process data from collections, arrays, I/O channels, etc.
    * **Why:** Allows for declarative and functional-style processing of data (filtering, mapping, reducing, etc.) often more efficiently and readably than traditional loops, especially for large datasets or parallel processing.

    ```java
    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
    names.stream()
         .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
         .forEach(System.out::println); // Using Method Reference too!
    ```

4.  **Default Methods in Interfaces:**
    * **What:** Methods in an interface that have a concrete implementation (marked with the `default` keyword).
    * **Why:** Allows adding new methods to existing interfaces *without breaking* the classes that already implement that interface (they automatically inherit the default implementation).

    ```java
    interface MyInterface {
        void requiredMethod(); // Abstract method
        default void newOptionalMethod() { // Default method
            System.out.println("Default implementation");
        }
    }
    ```

5.  **Static Methods in Interfaces:**
    * **What:** Methods in an interface that are declared `static`.
    * **Why:** Allows defining utility methods directly within interfaces, related to the interface's purpose (e.g., factory methods, helper methods).

    ```java
    interface MyInterface {
        static void helper() {
            System.out.println("Static helper method");
        }
    }
    // Call: MyInterface.helper();
    ```

6.  **Method References:**
    * **What:** A shorthand syntax for a lambda expression that does nothing but call an existing method or constructor.
    * **Why:** Makes code even more concise when the lambda's body is just a single method call.

    ```java
    // Lambda: s -> System.out.println(s)
    // Method Reference: System.out::println

    // Lambda: str -> new String(str)
    // Method Reference: String::new
    ```

7.  **Date and Time API (`java.time`):**
    * **What:** A completely new, immutable, and thread-safe API for handling dates, times, durations, time zones, etc.
    * **Why:** Replaces the old, problematic `java.util.Date` and `Calendar` classes. Provides clearer semantics, immutability, and better time zone handling.

    ```java
    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();
    LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    ZonedDateTime 서울시간 = ZonedDateTime.now(ZoneId.of("Asia/Seoul"));
    ```

8.  **`Optional<T>` Class:**
    * **What:** A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value.
    * **Why:** Provides a clear and explicit way to indicate that a method might return "no result" (instead of `null`), helping to reduce `NullPointerException`s and making code more readable about the possibility of a missing value.

    ```java
    Optional<String> greeting = Optional.of("Hello");
    Optional<String> emptyGreeting = Optional.empty();

    String message = greeting.orElse("Hi"); // "Hello"
    String defaultMessage = emptyGreeting.orElse("Hi"); // "Hi"

    greeting.ifPresent(System.out::println); // Prints "Hello"
    ```

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

Java 8 brought Lambdas (anonymous functions), Functional Interfaces (SAM), Streams (processing data), Default/Static methods in Interfaces (evolving interfaces), Method References (lambda shorthand), `java.time` (better date/time), and `Optional` (handling nulls). Focus on what each is and why it's useful.





### 31. Multithreading and Concurrency Basics (Creating Threads)

**Definition:** Multithreading in Java is the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently (appearing to run at the same time, especially on multi-core processors). Each thread is an independent path of execution within the same program.

**Why Use Multithreading?**

* **Responsiveness:** Keep the UI responsive while performing long-running tasks in the background.
* **Resource Utilization:** Make better use of CPU cores.
* **Simplified Design:** Model concurrent tasks more naturally.

**Creating Threads (Two Main Ways):**

1.  **Extend the `java.lang.Thread` class:**
    * Create a new class that extends `Thread`.
    * Override the `run()` method with the code that the thread should execute.
    * Create an object of your class and call its `start()` method.

2.  **Implement the `java.lang.Runnable` interface:**
    * Create a new class that implements the `Runnable` interface.
    * Implement the `run()` method with the code for the thread.
    * Create a `Thread` object, passing an instance of your `Runnable` implementation to its constructor.
    * Call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object.

**Which Way to Choose?**

Implementing `Runnable` is generally preferred because:

* Java doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes, so extending `Thread` prevents your class from extending any other useful base class.
* Separates the task (`Runnable`) from the thread mechanism (`Thread`), promoting better design.

**`start()` vs. `run()` Method:**

* **`start()`:**
    * This is the correct method to call to begin executing a new thread.
    * It performs necessary low-level operations (like allocating resources, registering the thread with the OS) and then calls the `run()` method in the newly created thread.
    * **Crucially, it creates and starts a *new* thread.**
* **`run()`:**
    * Contains the code that the thread will execute.
    * Calling `run()` directly simply executes the code within the `run()` method in the *current* thread (like a regular method call), *without* creating a new thread.

**Thread Lifecycle (Briefly):**

Threads go through several states:

* **New:** Thread object is created but not yet started.
* **Runnable:** Thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
* **Running:** Thread is currently executing on the CPU.
* **Blocked/Waiting:** Thread is temporarily inactive (e.g., waiting for I/O, waiting for a lock, sleeping).
* **Terminated:** Thread has finished its execution.

**The Need for Synchronization (Hint):**

When multiple threads share and modify the *same* resources (like variables or objects), you can encounter problems like data corruption or inconsistent results due to threads interfering with each other's operations. This is where **synchronization** is needed (using keywords like `synchronized`, locks, etc., which we can cover later if needed).

**Minimal Example (Using Runnable - Preferred):**

```java
// 1. Implement the Runnable interface
class MyRunnableTask implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;

    public MyRunnableTask(String name) {
        this.taskName = name;
    }

    // 2. Implement the run() method
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task '" + taskName + "' starting in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            // Simulate some work
            Thread.sleep(50);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Task '" + taskName + "' interrupted.");
        }
        System.out.println("Task '" + taskName + "' finished in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadCreationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread starting: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        // Create Runnable tasks
        MyRunnableTask task1 = new MyRunnableTask("Task 1");
        MyRunnableTask task2 = new MyRunnableTask("Task 2");

        // 3. Create Thread objects and pass Runnable tasks
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);

        // 4. Start the threads (calls the run() method in a *new* thread)
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // What happens if you call run() directly?
        // System.out.println("\nCalling run() directly:");
        // MyRunnableTask task3 = new MyRunnableTask("Task 3 (Direct Run)");
        // task3.run(); // This runs in the *main* thread, not a new one

        System.out.println("Main thread finished.");
    }
}
```
*(The output will show lines from Task 1, Task 2, and Main thread interleaved, demonstrating concurrency.)*

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* Multithreading runs multiple parts of your program concurrently.
* Create threads by `implementing Runnable` (preferred) or `extending Thread`.
* Call `start()` to run the `run()` method in a **new** thread.
* Calling `run()` directly just executes the code in the **current** thread.




### 32. Synchronization (`synchronized` Keyword)

**Definition:** Synchronization in Java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. The `synchronized` keyword is the primary built-in mechanism for achieving this.

**The Problem: Race Conditions**

When multiple threads try to access and modify the *same* shared data concurrently without proper control, the final result can be unpredictable and incorrect. This is called a **race condition**. Threads "race" to access and modify the shared resource, and the outcome depends on the non-deterministic order in which they execute.

**How `synchronized` Works:**

The `synchronized` keyword uses a concept called a **monitor** or **intrinsic lock**. Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock associated with it.

* When a thread enters a `synchronized` method or block, it attempts to acquire the monitor lock for the object associated with the method/block.
* If the lock is available, the thread acquires it and proceeds.
* If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread is blocked (waits) until the lock is released.
* When the thread holding the lock exits the `synchronized` method or block (either normally or due to an exception), the lock is released, allowing another waiting thread (if any) to acquire it.
* Only one thread can hold an object's monitor lock at a time.

**Applying `synchronized`:**

1.  **Synchronized Methods:**
    * Declaring an instance method with `synchronized` means that a thread must acquire the lock of the *instance* of the object before executing the method.
    * Declaring a `static` method with `synchronized` means a thread must acquire the lock of the `Class` object (e.g., `MyClass.class`) before executing the method. Static synchronized methods control access to static members.

    ```java
    public class Counter {
        private int count = 0;

        // Synchronized instance method - uses the Counter object's lock
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " increments to " + count);
        }

        // Synchronized static method - uses the Counter.class object's lock
        public static synchronized void staticIncrement() {
             // Access static members safely
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Synchronized Blocks:**
    * Provides more fine-grained control than synchronizing an entire method.
    * You specify an object whose lock will be acquired.
    * `synchronized (objectReference) { // Code to be synchronized }`

    ```java
    public class SharedResource {
        private int data = 0;
        private final Object lock = new Object(); // A dedicated lock object

        public void updateData() {
            // Only this block requires synchronization
            synchronized (lock) { // Acquire the lock of the 'lock' object
                data++;
                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " updates data to " + data);
            }
            // Other code here can run concurrently
        }

        public int getData() {
             return data;
        }
    }
    ```
    * Using `this` as the lock object (`synchronized(this)`) in an instance method is equivalent to making the entire method `synchronized`.
    * For static methods, `synchronized(ClassName.class)` is equivalent to making the entire static method `synchronized`.

**Example: Race Condition without vs. with Synchronization**

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Method WITHOUT synchronization (prone to race condition)
    public void incrementUnsynchronized() {
        count++;
        // In a multi-threaded environment, this operation (read -> increment -> write)
        // can be interrupted, leading to lost updates.
    }

     // Method WITH synchronization (safe)
    public synchronized void incrementSynchronized() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("--- Without Synchronization ---");
        Counter counter1 = new Counter();
        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter1.incrementUnsynchronized();
            }
        };

        Thread t1a = new Thread(task1, "Thread-1a");
        Thread t1b = new Thread(task1, "Thread-1b");

        t1a.start();
        t1b.start();

        t1a.join(); // Wait for thread 1a to finish
        t1b.join(); // Wait for thread 1b to finish

        // Expected count is 2000 (1000 from each thread), but often less due to race condition
        System.out.println("Final Count (Unsynchronized): " + counter1.getCount());
        System.out.println("--- Should be 2000, often less due to race condition ---\n");


        System.out.println("--- With Synchronization ---");
        Counter counter2 = new Counter(); // Use a new counter instance
         Runnable task2 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter2.incrementSynchronized(); // Use synchronized method
            }
        };

        Thread t2a = new Thread(task2, "Thread-2a");
        Thread t2b = new Thread(task2, "Thread-2b");

        t2a.start();
        t2b.start();

        t2a.join(); // Wait for thread 2a to finish
        t2b.join(); // Wait for thread 2b to finish

        // Expected count is 2000, and it will be correct with synchronization
        System.out.println("Final Count (Synchronized): " + counter2.getCount());
         System.out.println("--- Will be 2000 with synchronization ---\n");
    }
}
```
*(Run this code multiple times to see the `Unsynchronized` count vary, while the `Synchronized` count is always 2000.)*

**Other Synchronization Mechanisms (Brief Mention):**

Besides `synchronized`, Java provides other tools in the `java.util.concurrent.locks` and `java.util.concurrent.atomic` packages for more advanced concurrency control, such as `Lock` objects, `ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`, `Semaphore`, and atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`, etc.). `volatile` is another keyword related to visibility, often used alongside synchronization.

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* Synchronization prevents race conditions with shared resources in multithreaded code.
* `synchronized` uses intrinsic object locks (monitors).
* Apply `synchronized` to methods or blocks.
* Synchronized methods lock the object instance (or Class object for static methods).
* Synchronized blocks lock the object specified in parentheses `(objectReference)`.
* Only one thread can hold a lock at a time, ensuring exclusive access to the synchronized code/resource.



### 33. `volatile` Keyword

**Definition:** The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads. It guarantees that reads from and writes to the variable are directly to and from main memory, ensuring visibility of the latest value across threads.

**The Problem it Solves: Visibility Issues**

In multi-threaded applications, threads often work with copies of variables stored in their own CPU caches for performance. If one thread modifies a shared variable, other threads might not immediately see the updated value because they are looking at their stale cache copy, not the version in main memory. `volatile` addresses this **visibility** problem.

**How it Works:**

* **Guarantees Visibility:** When a variable is declared `volatile`, the Java Memory Model (JMM) ensures that:
    * When a thread writes to a `volatile` variable, the value is immediately written back to main memory.
    * When a thread reads a `volatile` variable, it always reads the latest value from main memory (invalidating its local cache if necessary).
* **Prevents Reordering:** `volatile` also provides a limited form of ordering guarantee. It prevents the compiler or processor from reordering instructions in a way that would break the visibility guarantee around the `volatile` variable. Specifically, writes to volatile variables cannot be reordered with subsequent reads or writes, and reads from volatile variables cannot be reordered with prior reads or writes. (This relates to "happens-before" rules).

**What `volatile` Does NOT Guarantee: Atomicity**

`volatile` guarantees visibility, but it *does not* guarantee atomicity for compound operations (operations that involve multiple steps like read-modify-write).

For example, `count++` is typically a three-step operation:
1. Read the current value of `count`.
2. Increment the value.
3. Write the new value back.

If two threads concurrently perform `volatile int count; count++;`, a race condition can still occur because the read, increment, and write steps are not atomic. Both threads might read the same initial value before either writes the updated value back.

**`volatile` vs. `synchronized` (Key Difference):**

* **`volatile`:** Guarantees **visibility** and prevents some instruction **reordering**. It *doesn't* provide mutual exclusion (atomicity for compound operations).
* **`synchronized`:** Guarantees **visibility** (by flushing caches on entry/exit) AND provides **mutual exclusion** (atomicity for the synchronized block/method - only one thread can execute it at a time).

Use `volatile` when only visibility is needed for a simple variable (like a flag). Use `synchronized` (or locks) when you need both visibility *and* atomicity for blocks of code or compound operations on shared data.

**Simple Declaration Example:**

```java
public class SharedData {
    // Without volatile, changes to 'flag' might not be seen by other threads immediately.
    // boolean flag = false;

    // With volatile, changes to 'flag' will be visible to all threads.
    volatile boolean flag = false;

    // If this was count++, volatile wouldn't be enough to prevent race conditions.
    volatile int status = 0;
}
```

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* `volatile` guarantees **visibility** of a variable's latest value across threads (reads from/writes to main memory).
* It prevents certain instruction reordering around the variable.
* **Crucially, it does NOT guarantee atomicity** for operations like `++` or `--`.
* Use for simple flags or status indicators where only visibility is needed.
* `synchronized` provides both visibility *and* atomicity.




### 34. `instanceof` Keyword

**Definition:** The `instanceof` keyword is a binary operator used to test if an object is an instance of a specific class, a subclass of a class, or implements a particular interface.

**Purpose:**

It allows you to check the actual type of an object at runtime before attempting a type cast or calling methods specific to that type. This helps prevent `ClassCastException`s.

**Syntax:**

```java
objectReference instanceof Type
```
* `objectReference`: The object you want to test.
* `Type`: The class or interface you are checking against.

It returns `true` if the `objectReference` is an instance of `Type` or a subtype of `Type`, and `false` otherwise. If `objectReference` is `null`, `instanceof` always returns `false`.

**Simple Example:**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}
class Cat extends Animal {}

public class InstanceofExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        Animal anotherAnimal = new Cat();
        List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

        System.out.println("myAnimal is an Animal: " + (myAnimal instanceof Animal)); // true
        System.out.println("myAnimal is a Dog: " + (myAnimal instanceof Dog));     // true
        System.out.println("myAnimal is a Cat: " + (myAnimal instanceof Cat));     // false

        System.out.println("anotherAnimal is an Animal: " + (anotherAnimal instanceof Animal)); // true
        System.out.println("anotherAnimal is a Cat: " + (anotherAnimal instanceof Cat)); // true

        System.out.println("myList is a List: " + (myList instanceof List));       // true
        System.out.println("myList is an ArrayList: " + (myList instanceof ArrayList)); // true
        System.out.println("myList is an Animal: " + (myList instanceof Animal));   // false

        Object obj = "Hello";
        if (obj instanceof String) {
            String str = (String) obj; // Safe cast after checking
            System.out.println("obj is a String: " + str.toUpperCase());
        }

        Object nullObj = null;
        System.out.println("nullObj is a String: " + (nullObj instanceof String)); // false
    }
}
```

**Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Java 14+):**

Modern Java simplifies `instanceof` usage. You can combine the type check and variable binding:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
if (obj instanceof String str) { // Check AND declare/assign 'str' if true
    // No need for explicit cast here, 'str' is already String type
    System.out.println("obj is a String: " + str.toUpperCase());
}
```
This reduces boilerplate and improves readability.

**Key Takeaway (Fast):**

* `instanceof` checks if an object is of a certain type or subtype at runtime.
* Syntax: `object instanceof Type`.
* Returns `true` or `false`. Returns `false` for `null`.
* Useful before casting to prevent `ClassCastException`.
* Java 14+ offers pattern matching (`instanceof Type variable`) for conciseness.
